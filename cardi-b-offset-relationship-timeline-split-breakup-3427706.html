Their son,&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Wave</strong></a>, made his debut in Sept. 2021.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>The pair have endured their fair share of marital woes in public, including two divorce filings and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>multiple cheating allegations</a>. Sadly, Cardi confirmed that <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the couple split</a> on December 10, 2023. Read on for a timeline of Cardi B and Offset’s relationship: Their highs, their lows, and everything in between.</p><h2>Who is Offset?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>Offset (née Kiari Kendrell Cephus) is an American rapper and songwriter from Atlanta, Ga. He’s best known for being 1/3 of the hip-hop trio Migos, which included his cousins, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Quavo&nbsp;</strong></a>and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Takeoff</strong></a>. Unfortunately, Takeoff was&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>shot and killed</a> in Nov. 2022.&nbsp; In addition to his music ventures, Offset has appeared in a few television series (including<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong> Donald Glover</strong></a>‘s Atlanta), he’s modeled in fashion campaigns, and as of 2019, he became an investor in the Esports organization FaZe Clan. Along with Kulture and Wave,<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Offset has three other children</a> from previous relationships.</p><h2>Cardi B and Offset’s Relationship</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/cardi-b-offset-2019-billboard-tounge-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>It’s believed that Cardi and Offset met sometime in late 2016. Offset shed light on their beginnings during a Jan. 2018 profile with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Rolling Stone</a>, when he revealed that he initiated a dinner date in Cardi’s native New York through their publicists. “The couple met about a year ago at Offset’s insistence – while he watched her rise as an artist, his interest grew, then exploded,” the Rolling Stone profile read. “I was like, ‘Damn, I am on her!’” Offset recalled. “I am like, ‘S***, I like Cardi B!’</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Some would argue that Cardi and Offset’s first official public date was in Feb. 2017, at <strong>Super Bowl LI</strong> (51) in Houston. The two <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>were photographed</a> holding hands at the big game, which Cardi previously said was the point when their relationship became serious.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>“I told my publicist to tell him, because I was very shy, ‘Listen, if we gonna go on a public date together, you cannot make me look like a dumbass after this,’” Cardi recalled to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>GQ</a> in April 2018. “And he was like, ‘No, I really like her. I’m really feeling her.’ We was talking, we was making out. We didn’t f***. After the Super Bowl, it got really serious because I feel, like, all eyes on us.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>In May 2017, Cardi and Offset released their&nbsp;first collaboration “Lick” and its accompanying video, which showed the rappers on a steamy casino date.</p><h2>The Big Proposal</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/cardi-b-offset-relationship-timeline-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-11>After an unconventional order of events — the two tied the knot in secret, and then Offset publicly proposed. He popped the question on stage at Power 99’s Powerhouse concert in Philadelphia with a 20-carat diamond. He later told Rolling Stone that he decided to propose because he respects everything Cardi is and stands for. “She’s herself, man. I seen her develop from the trenches all the way up, and I like how she did it,” he raved. “I respect her grind as a woman.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>Although Cardi was sure she and Offset would walk down the aisle, she told <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jimmy Fallon</strong></a> in Dec. 2017 that she was still surprised by the flashy proposal. “I mean, he always used to tell me, ‘I’m going to marry you. I’m going to marry you.’ And it’s just like, ‘Mmm. It’s the right thing to do,'” she <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>explained</a>. “But I knew he was going to give me a very expensive gift because he wasn’t there for my birthday, but I thought he was going to give me a watch or something. He just went out of his way, okurrrrr!”</p><h2>Daughter Kulture</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/cardi-b-offset-relationship-timeline-embed5.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-13>Cardi B gave birth to her first child with Offset on July 10, 2018. The couple welcomed a<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> beautiful baby girl</a>, Kulture Kiara, whose name was inspired by her father. Kulture’s middle name, Kiari, is her father’s real name. Despite major speculation, the rap couple kept Cardi’s pregnancy a secret — until she finally debuted her baby bump during a performance on <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Saturday Night Live</a> in April of 2018.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><h2>Divorce Talks</h2><p id=content-paragraph-14>Cardi shockingly <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>filed for divorce</a> from the “Legacy” rapper on Sept. 15, 2020. <strong>HollywoodLife</strong> obtained the official court documents, which showed they were filed by the rapper in Georgia, where the couple has a home together. The legal documents, which came not long after Cardi caught Offset cheating for the second time, stated that the pair had been separated and that “there are no prospects for a reconciliation.” Additionally, the divorce documents revealed that Cardi requested primary physical custody, as well as legal custody, of the couple’s then 2-year-old daughter.</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>After Cardi filed for divorce, she continued to share <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PDA videos with Offset</a> on social media. The pair even rang in her 28th birthday together in Las Vegas on Oct. 13, 2020. Two days later, the “WAP” rapper took to social media to reveal that she was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>back with Offset</a>. She also explained that it wasn’t her intention to go through with the divorce filing — let alone for the legal documents to go public. Instead, Cardi explained that she filed for divorce to “teach [Offset] a lesson” because they had been arguing a lot at the time. By Nov. 2, Cardi had filed an amended divorce petition to retract her initial filing. <strong>HollywoodLife</strong> obtained the original and revised filings.</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>Following their reconciliation, a person close to the couple <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>revealed to HollywoodLife <strong>EXCLUSIVELY</strong> </a>that Offset planned to do all he could to win back Cardi’s trust. “Offset is on his best behavior right now. He’s doing everything he can to prove to Cardi that he’s worth it,” they divulged. “He knows he’s not perfect, but he really does feel that he and Cardi belong together and he’s putting all his focus on her. He was miserable without her and he knows he’s beyond lucky to have a woman like her so he’s just doing all he can to convince her not to go through with the divorce.”</p><h2>2nd Pregnancy</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/cardi-b-pregnant-offset-bet-awards-2021-embed1-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-17>Cardi announced that she was pregnant with <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>baby No. 2</a>&nbsp;on June 27, 2021 during the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>BET Awards</a>.

The <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Grammy Award-winning rapper</a> took to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Twitter</a> to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>defend her name</a> by sharing a voice memo in which she both sang and spoke to her fans. “First of all, let me say, you can’t accuse me of all the things you know that&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>you are guilty of</a>.
