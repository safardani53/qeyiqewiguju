That’s what he was.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">To see what an impact this 17-year-old gorilla had on his species, you just need to look at the impressive extended family (both blood relatives and zoo mates) he left behind. Harambe, along with these primates, was a member of an endangered species <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>estimated to have a population of around 175,000 left in the wild</a>. Their number continues to dwindle due to poaching, deforestation and diseases. Harambe was one of just <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>765 western lowland gorillas living in zoos worldwide</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Below, meet the gorillas who will be missing Harambe the most.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><br><strong>Zoo Family</strong><br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Harambe lived with 10 other gorillas at the Cincinnati Zoo, two of which resided in the same enclosure.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Chewie & Mara</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Chewie and Mara were the females paired with Harambe when the silverback arrived in 2014. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>The two gorillas were chosen for the young newcomer</a> because they both have experience living with different males. At 17, Harambe had not yet reached breeding maturity when he died. Residing with Chewie and Mara was seen as “training” for the male, so he could become comfortable in a leadership position.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Asha</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Asha is one of Harambe’s half-siblings born from the same father (Moja) in 2002. Like Harambe, Asha was born at the Gladys Porter Zoo in Texas and moved to the Cincinnati Zoo as part of the Species Survival Program.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Gladys</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Gladys is another one of Harambe’s half-siblings residing at the Cincinnati Zoo. Similar to Asha, she was born at the Gladys Porter Zoo to father Moja and was later moved to her current Ohio home. Gladys was born in 2013 and was raised by human surrogates. She was later introduced to M’Linzi at the Cincinnati Zoo, who took on the role of surrogate gorilla mom.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>M’Linzi</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">M’Linzi is the mom of the group. The 33-year-old gorilla gave birth to Mara and served as a surrogate for Gladys. M’Linzi was born at the Cincinnati Zoo in December 1982.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Jomo</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Jomo is the other (and now only) male silverback western lowland gorilla at the Cincinnati Zoo. He lives in an enclosure separate from Harambe with Mona, Elle, Gladys, Samantha, M’Linzi, Asha and Anju. Born in 1991 at the Toronto Zoo and later moved to Ohio, Jomo is the father of three gorillas so far.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Mondika (Mona)</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Mona was born at the Cincinnati Zoo</a> to parents Asha and Jomo in 2014.

Both of his parents are now deceased. Moja, originally from the Metro Miami Zoo, died suddenly at the Gladys Porter Zoo to heart disease. Kayla died in 2002, due to chlorine poisoning, at the Texas zoo as well.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-77 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Harambe’s one full sibling, a brother named Makoko, died in the same 2002 chlorine poisoning incident as Kayla. In January 2002, a container of dry chlorine tablets was accidentally placed near a space heater in a building housing 11 gorillas, reports <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>The Brownsville Herald</a>. The tablets accidentally became wet, creating toxic fumes that ended up killing four gorillas: Kayla, Makoko and two of Harambe’s half-siblings, Caesar and Uzuri.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-79 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Two of Harambe’s other half-siblings are also deceased: Pearl who died of unknown causes before she turned 1 and an unnamed baby who was miscarried.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-83 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-85 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Born in 1998, N’zinga is Harambe’s oldest living half-sibling.
