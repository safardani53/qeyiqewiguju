After nearly four decades in the spotlight, we can always count on the multi-hyphenate to take a sartorial risk with her avant-garde red carpet looks.</p><p>The Golden Globe-winner was just 11 years old when she made her Broadway debut in 1976, and she’s been working on the big and small screen (and stage!) ever since. In 1998, Parker began her career-defining turn as Carrie Bradshaw, and while she said she has never felt as though her characters influence her style, there is no denying SJP and her on-screen counterpart share the same fearless attitude when it comes to dressing.</p><p>From her thematic Met Gala looks (need we remind you of the fiery Philip Treacy headpiece she donned at the 2015 “China: Through The Looking Glass”-themed event or Hamilton-inspired separates she wore the following year?) to her more-is-more styling philosophy (think: piled-on necklaces, sexy hosiery, pattern play and lot of layers), Parker clearly loves fashion and we love her for it.</p><p>In addition to her acting work, the mom of three has also forged a path in the fashion and beauty industries. She has her own fragrance collection and accessories line, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">SJP by Sarah Jessica Parker</a>, and has collaborated with Halston Heritage, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gap</a> and more. As a designer, Parker has made it clear that she creates pieces that can mix and match into her costumers’ existing wardrobe.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Style is what the individual brings.
