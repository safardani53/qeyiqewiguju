The notion emerged when the actor from Don’t Look Up began dating Brazilian model Gisele Bundchen.&nbsp;Bundchen was 20 years old at the time, while DiCaprio was almost 25. The couple dated for five years before splitting up in 2005, the year Bundchen turned 25. Soon after, the former started dating Bar Refaeli, a 20-year-old model.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Camila-Morrone.jpg alt="Camila Morrone" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The pair allegedly split up in 2011, just after Refaeli turned 26. DiCaprio subsequently began dating 23-year-old Blake Lively, but the couple split before the actress turned 25. He also had a romance with German model Toni Garrn between 2013 and 2014, however they split up before she turned 26.&nbsp;DiCaprio’s second long-term romance started in 2017 with 19-year-old Camila Morrone.
