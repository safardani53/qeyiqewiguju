The lovers? Orlando Bloom, John Mayer, and Diplo.
Her answer is … not the most flattering.
Katy Perry’s brand has taken a few weird turns, you know?

But it gives him something in common with Katy, sort of.</p><p>Orlando Bloom is more widely known, and was part of the sexual awakening of plenty of folks who were teens when The Fellowship of the Ring and the first Pirates of the Caribbean came out.</p><p>Now it’s, like, 16 years later, and he still looks good — <a href=#>even when naked</a>.</p><p>He and Katy also had an <a href=#>amicable breakup</a>, like actual adults, which is pretty refreshing in the world of relentless Hollywood drama.</p><p>John Mayer has a reputation for giving off a pretty skeezy vibe, though he’s tried to make up for that in recent years.</p><p>Honestly, since Katy Perry made it clear that <a href=#>they aren’t going to date again</a>, we hope that her praise doesn’t confuse him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>He strikes us as the kind of guy who’d hear "I’d have sex with him again" and think that it means that she wants him back.</p><p>In general, playing truth-or-dare on a livestream when you’re both celebrities isn’t the best idea, even if you both kind of have a feel for the other’s boundaries.</p><p>Ranking lovers is pretty vanilla when it comes to truth-sharing, but it is not when you are a celebrity and all three of them are celebrities (Diplo shouldn’t count but let’s just let him have this).</p><p>They have fans who adore them and, like literally all humans, they don’t want anyone thinking that they’re bad at sex.</p><p>Of course, it’s possible that Katy’s answer was very calculated.</p><p>If you think about it, Diplo’s the lowest on the "food chain" of those three, so of course you’d rank him last.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Orlando Bloom may not be his hottest self anymore, but he’s still widely recognized as being astonishingly good-looking. Plus, you know, those nude photos were wildly flattering.</p><p>So, of the two, Bloom might have the least need for additional praise.</p><p>Though … there’s always the chance that John Mayer is actually just really good at sex. Sometimes even the skeeziest guys are.</p><p>Sometimes they have that one thing going for them.</p><p>Someone could ask Taylor Swift if she agrees with Katy about their mutual ex … but honestly, who would dare?</p><p>We spent the last couple of years feeling a little fatigued about Katy Perry, but we have to admit that we’re interested to see what she gets up to next.</p><p>But if she wants to share anymore celebrity bedroom secrets, we’re up for hearing those, too.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pvX2WDcLfArbBmqJWnv7p50ZqlpKtdnbKzecSxnKxlkal6tLHXZqqenV2stbC%2FjJucrKxdlruledaoqaysXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
