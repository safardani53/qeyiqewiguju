At the time, Siwa uploaded a photo in which she was wearing a black t-shirt that read, “Best. Gay. Cousin. Ever.”</p><p>After coming out, the Nickelodeon star received <a href=#>support from her celebrity friends</a>, including <a href=#><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Kerry Washington</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Jamie Lynn Spears</strong></a>, among others. She also hosted an Instagram Live that was flooded with positive comments from her millions of followers.</p><p>“Personally, I have never, ever, ever been this happy before and it feels really awesome,” Siwa told viewers. “I’ve been happy for a little bit now. It’s just so, so, so awesome.”</p><p>Shortly after coming out, the “Kid in a Candy Store” songstress appeared on a February 2021 episode of <a href=#>The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon</a> and revealed that she had “the most amazing, wonderful, perfect, most beautiful girlfriend in the whole world” at the time.</p><p>While speaking with host <a href=#><strong>Jimmy Fallon</strong></a>, the singer explained that “10 minutes before” she was “crying” on the phone with Prew. “She’s like, ‘What’s wrong with you?’ And I was like, ‘I’m just so happy because now I get to share what makes me the happiest with the world, and it makes my heart so happy,’” she recalled.</p><p>At the time, Siwa kept her significant other’s identity under wraps, but eventually shared that the Florida teen was the one who had stolen her heart. The&nbsp;duo met on a cruise ship and eventually went from being best friends to something more.</p><p>“We were just hanging out and then I was like, ‘Woah, this girl is fun,’” Siwa said during an interview with <a href=#>J-14</a> in December 2020 about the first time they met. “I was like ‘You are insane, and I love you to death.’ So, I met my best friend last year on Christmas Eve, actually.”</p><p class=p1>However, Us<i> Weekly&nbsp;</i>confirmed in October 2021 that the&nbsp;<i>J Team&nbsp;</i>star and Prew <a href=#>had called it quits on their romance</a> after less than one year of dating.</p><p class=p1>“We officially broke up the morning that I did the Prince Charming number on&nbsp;<i>Dancing With the Stars</i>,” Siwa <a href=#>exclusively told&nbsp;<i>Us</i>&nbsp;one month later</a>. “It’s been a few weeks and it’s been tough, but we’re getting through it. … We’re going to go back to being friends.”</p><p>Since coming out, the YouTube star has continued to <a href=#>speak openly about her sexuality</a> and refuses to let <a href=#>the haters get her down</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“People are going to say it’s not normal, but nothing is normal,” Siwa said in a January Instagram Live. “Literally not one thing about anybody is normal and it’s OK not to be normal, it’s OK to be a little different, it’s OK to be a little weird, strange, different. That’s something we should never, ever be afraid of. That’s something we should be proud of. … I’m the happiest I’ve ever been, that’s what matters.”</p><p>Scroll through the gallery below to see what Siwa has said about coming out and her relationship:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNksrex0bKroaGenHqru8moZKyhp5Z6qa3SZqqaoZRirqO71K1knKednruoec6uq2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
