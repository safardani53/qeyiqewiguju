She topped off the bohemian chic vibe with an orange beanie, an oversized tote and a set of wedge shoes. At one point, she pulled out a bubble wand and began to blow bubbles. Ol, meanwhile, kept it casual in an oxford and khakis as he handed over the phone with a smile.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>The actress had first met Ol while they both worked on a television project back in 1996. Two years later, they married and eventually welcomed three children together: daughters <strong>Ripley</strong>, born in 2000, and&nbsp;<strong>Nico</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Parker</strong>, born in 2004, and son&nbsp;<strong>Booker Jombe</strong>, born in 2014.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Thandiwe-Newton-Ol-Parker-Reunit-SS-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>At the brief reunion, Thandiwe was seen without her boyfriend, 25-year-old musician <strong>Lonr</strong>&nbsp;(real name&nbsp;<strong>Elijah Dias</strong>). The pair sparked romance rumors after they <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>packed on the PDA</a> during a stroll together in Miami in April. Then a month later, they were <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>spotted on a sushi date</a>, where they canoodled outside the famed Matsuhisa restaurant in Hollywood.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Thandiwe is not only in the midst of a split from her husband — she’s also dealing with the aftermath of <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>reportedly being fired</a> from Magic Mike 3&nbsp;after getting in a heated argument with its star&nbsp;<strong>Channing Tatum</strong>. In addition, the film’s production team was reportedly concerned about Thandiwe’s mental health. “Thandiwe had been acting strangely on the set … enough that producers were worried about her state of mind,” a source told the outlet. However, a spokesperson for Warner Bros. said in a statement, “Thandiwe Newton has made the difficult decision to step away from the production of Warner Bros. Pictures’ ‘Magic Mike’s Last Dance’ to deal with family matters.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH14e5JpZq2gkaOxqsPEZqWer6Sku267y2anmqqbmr9uvsSupaKslWKzqr7SrWSpoJ%2BpvLR7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
