But PLEASE you guys, stop asking me for $ on @venmo,” the&nbsp;<a href=#>Vanderpump Rules</a>&nbsp;star, 34, <a href=#>tweeted</a> on Friday, March 20. “It makes me feel terrible reading your stories of why you need $$ and <a href=#>I am not rich</a>! I support my family and have a ton of friends in the same situation right now. I wish I could help everyone but I can’t.”</p><p>She continued: “My dad is still doing hard labor working full time during this pandemic. My mom does more than I could ever ask her for and who the hell wouldn’t want their mom to be able to help them full time w work. PLEASE stop asking me for $$. I can not afford to save the [world].”</p><p>Shay went on to emphasize that she understood from where the fans asking for help were coming. “I didn’t grow up rich,” she <a href=#>wrote</a>. “My family worked very hard to give me an amazing childhood and everything i wanted. But i do know what it’s like to check my bank account 7x a day to see if the auto debit came out or not so I could pay rent. I get the struggle & I empathize.”</p><p>The reality star then shared her hope for those in need because she overcame a similar situation. “I maxed out every credit card I had. But I NEVER once asked for a handout from ANYONE, let alone a stranger on TV,” she concluded. “I love you all but please, i had to figure it all out on my own and I did and I’m okay! I have faith you’ll be able to do the same.”</p><p>Shay drew ire earlier this month for her reaction to the coronavirus outbreak. “Any of my friends working from home this week should come join me for a <a href=#>Palm Springs quarantine</a>!” she tweeted on Saturday, March 14. “I will continue to live my life in Palm Springs or MDR w my friends and not live it in complete isolation or fear. Simple as that. Call me ‘ignorant’ but I’m not gonna stop living!”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The TV personality later accused fellow social media users of being hypocrites before apologizing. “For those who expressed concern or viewed my remarks as insensitive, I had just returned from a work trip and wasn’t fully updated on the pandemic,” she explained. “I now understand the severity of our current predicament. Please stay safe, and wash your damn hands!”</p><p>Given the constantly evolving nature of COVID-19, Us Weekly wants our readers to have access to the most accurate resources.
