After 27.5 hours of labor, she flew into the world and expanded our hearts.

It’s been rough,” the Australia native <a href=#>said during an Instagram Story Q&A</a> weeks after giving birth to Elle. “Bleeding nips aren’t fun for anyone.

Obviously what we went through was tragic, but it brought us so much closer together. And I think it’s difficult to say this, because I would have loved to have had the baby and the pregnancy work out, but I wouldn’t change it because I learned so much and it really strengthened our relationship.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGacpJGev6Z5x6ijrWWZqHqxvsSgpZqmpGKyubzEnKuippdigLOwjJuYm7FdrLa1tIyhrKyakaOxbrzHqKuoZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
