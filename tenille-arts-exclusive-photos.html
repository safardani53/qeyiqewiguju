She made her first appearance on The Bachelor in January 2018 singing her original song “Moment of Weakness.” The performance resulted in a record deal with powerhouse indie label Reviver Records. She made her second appearance on the show in January of 2019 performing “I Hate This.” The song hit #1 on both the U.S. and Canadian iTunes Country Charts and #9 U.S. iTunes all-genre following the episode. Her third appearance on The Bachelor preceded the release of her new album Love, Heartbreak, & Everything In Between in January of 2020. Tenille’s music has tallied over 51 million lifetime streams. Noted music critic Tom Roland was so moved by her music that he has penned three full-page features in the Billboard Country Update. Music Row Magazine critic Robert K. Oermann called Tenille “Promising in the extreme.” Streaming giant Pandora named her one of their new artists to watch, and CMT included her in their “Ten Must-See Indies You Need to Know,” a video discovery program that spotlights rising independent artists and established artists from independent labels. Rolling Stone named Tenille one of their “10 New Country Artists You Need To Know,” calling her “An edgy, Fearless-era Taylor Swift with crystalline vocals; ideal for hopeless romantics who are fire signs,” and PopCulture named her one of their “Country Artists to Watch in 2018.” Tenille made her Grand Ole Opry debut on September 21, 2019 and performed at the Grand Ole Opry at the historic Ryman Auditorium on January 3, 2020. National television appearances include the TODAY Show, the Radio Disney Music Awards and singing the Canadian National Anthem at game 3 of the 2019 NBA finals and at the 2020 NBA All Star Game.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGinopujZMGmusilo55lkafBtHnEsZqlraOew6Z5z6GmraejZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
