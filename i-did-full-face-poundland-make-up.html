I'm excited for that.”</p><p>First for the base foundation.&nbsp;</p><p>Alishba said: “We're starting off with the Illuminating Foundation. So this kind of gives me Charlotte Tilbury vibes. I got the shade Olive. This is actually blending in quite nicely. It’s giving a glow to the skin."</p><p>Alishba was convinced the Poundland Illuminating Foundation was a dupe for the Charlotte Tilbury Light Wonder Foundation which cost £39.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more in hair and beauty ">Read more in hair and beauty</h2><p>She said: “It looks like the Charlotte Tilbury Wonder skin, the light foundation, and I'm telling you, it's like a dupe on my skin right now. I'm not being dramatic, I used to work for Charlotte Tilbury and I'm getting the same finish and look at that glow.”</p><p>Alishba went in next with concealer.&nbsp;</p><p>She said: "I don't know if this is gonna be the right shade for me. Oh, this looks a bit too light."</p><p>Even though the concealer was too light, Alishba gave her verdict.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Fabulous</h2></p><p>She said :"Alright the concealer is a little bit patchy if I'm honest with you. And obviously ashy because it's too light for my skin. But I can't get over the glow of the foundation.”</p><p>Next Alishba went in with contour.&nbsp;</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>FABULOUS BINGO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Get a £20 bonus & 30 free spins when you spend £10 today</a></strong></p><p>She said: “Oh, it's kind of thick. The application process was a bit hard, but let's see how that blends."</p><p>Once Alishba had blended in the contour she was very impressed with the finish.&nbsp;</p><p>She said: “You know what? It's actually quite nice. It gives a really nice finish. And it doesn't look patchy at all. It looks very smooth. It is really creamy, very pigmented and a little bit goes a long way. You don’t have to go on top with powder and it looks really good in person."</p><p>Alishba went in with a blush next.&nbsp;</p><p>She said: “It’s looking very, like, highlighting vibes,it's kinda reminding me of NARS. Is it a dupe for NARS?”</p><p>Alishba’s video gained over 252,000 viewers with many viewers weighing on which high-end brands Poundland was attempting to dupe.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/charlotte-tilbury-light-wonder-foundation-789874202.jpg><p>Viewers were convinced that Poundland blush was a dupe for Fenty's Killawatt Freestyle highlighter in the shade 3D Baby Pink Shimmer which is £28.&nbsp;</p><p>One commenter said: "The blush looks like a dupe for the Fenty one”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Another said: “Applicator for concealer is like Huda Beauty.”</p><p>Alishba continued the rest of her Poundland face in another <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">video</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/fenty-blush-789871455.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5FqaGppY2uFcLWMnaCdZZaqua15xZqanmWgpMKvsMuapZ1lnZa4pnnUqWY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
