Simply put, the royals screwed things up for themselves by alienating Harry and spoonfeeding negative Meghan stories to racist tabloids.
With Queen Elizabeth II gone but not forgotten, there is only one person who could conceivably repair the damage."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

But after years of mistreatment, it was time for a new direction.</p><p>Prince Harry watched a British media maelstrom destroy his mother. He wasn’t going to watch it happen to his wife.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1678536130-1024x683.jpg><p>Prince Harry has detailed a lot of what he and his wife faced, between a number of interviews and his bestselling memoir, Spare.</p><p>Over time, Harry and Meghan have both attempted to extend olive branches. They don’t hate his family; they just couldn’t continue as things were and had to protect themselves.</p><p>However, it sounds like Charles — and a few others — are the ones stonewalling them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>“It’s complex, but there’s increasing frustration from some of the wider circle of family members that Charles won’t just fix things for the sake of everyone,” one royal source dished.</p><p>A friend of Harry’s shared that he reached out to his father last year to wish the family a Merry Christmas. He hoped to break the ice.</p><p>“It was an awkward conversation,” this friend admitted. “But he knew if he didn’t make those first steps, there would never be any progress.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-918607948-1024x683.jpg><p>“There were no raised voices, no arguments … but the King was cold and brief rather than open to any proper dialogue,” the book shares.</p><p>Scobie also alleged that “both the institution and the family” were struggling to “come to grips” with one simple reality.</p><p>Harry and Meghan have enjoyed massive personal and professional success after leaving the royal firm in their wake. This is not the vibe that the royal family wants to put out — and they even fear upstaging by Harry and Meghan’s triumphs.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/GettyImages-906665892-1024x699.jpg><p>“I’ve watched Kensington Palace and Buckingham Palace repeatedly get worried about being upstaged and derailed by the couple,” Scobie wrote.</p><p>“And,” he continued, “leak negative information on Harry and Meghan.” That part is no surprise.</p><p>Scobie observed that this messy business went down “during moments that could easily be focused on genuine royal news instead.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/05/GettyImages-1252751938-1024x683.jpg><p>“After Harry’s exit, William is considerably more alone in the battle of his two selves,” Scobie then observed.</p><p>“Even though they were always on different paths,” he noted. “Harry and William once shared an office, worked on the same foundations, and wanted to protect their families from the things they both feared.”</p><p>An addition source cited that William and Charles “have been unified in their frustrations with Harry.” Many have observed their similar dispositions. It is never a compliment.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-1180634745-626x1024.jpg><p>A new <a href=#>Vanity Fair report</a> confirms that Meghan Markle personally told Charles about royal racism. This impacted her and, of course, Charles’ own grandchild — now, grandchildren.</p><p>It’s a keen reminder that Charles has had many opportunities to correct injustices and resolve this situation.</p><p>Instead, he was part of driving away Harry and Meghan. And now, he is seemingly too proud or too stubborn to try to fix his mistake.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2trX2Z%2BcLfIp55mm5iWv62x0magnJ2jYry2wIypqaKmk5p6qa3Rq7BmnqKqwLW%2BwK2crGWipMaiuIyfmKahnK58</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
