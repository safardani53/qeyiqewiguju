He used a Reddit post from u/Wolfygirl97 as a reference, as she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">shared a list</a> of about 50 food items that are most likely leaving the chain restaurant's menu.</p><p>There are way too many fan-favorite items leaving the menu, including but not limited to: Smokehouse BBQ Chicken Sandwich, Bistro French Onion Soup, Broccoli Cheddar Mac & Cheese, All Flatbread Pizzas, BBQ Chicken Salad, Baja Bowl, Citrus Asian Crunch Salad with Chicken, and the Frozen Caramel and Chocolate Cold Brew.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Now, it's important to note that we haven't received actual confirmation from Panera regarding its menu changes. This is purely speculation from patrons, but we can't lie — this list looks pretty legit.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In an official statement, Panera did not confirm or deny whether the items featured on the list are actually leaving the menu. However, the company suggested that the changes may only impact a select number of its restaurants.</p><p>In response to the menu changes, a spokesperson for Panera issued the following statement to Distractify: "As part of our effort to continually improve our guest experience, we test different menu options in a small number of Panera bakery-cafes with the goal of providing a faster and more convenient guest experience while also simplifying operations for our associates. We routinely run these tests to identify new ways to better serve our guests, whether that’s through menu innovation, simplification or new technology. This program is being tested in less than 3% of our nationwide bakery-cafes."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Although nothing is set in stone, customers have already been grieving the loss of some of their favorite items.</p><p>"WHY ON EARTH ARE THEY GETTING RID OF THE KITCHEN SINK COOKIE," one fan lamented in the comment section of Zach's video. Another said, "Soufflés? The ONLY reason I ever step in a Panera."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"NOT FRENCH ONION," a third person cried, while a fourth agreed: "FRENCH ONION SOUP NOOOOOO!"</p><p>Someone else commented that getting rid of "Pumpkin muffin on the brink of pumpkin season is a BOLD CHOICE."</p><p>"Are they trying to go out of business?" a TikToker asked the question we're all wondering.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>i refuse to believe the rumors are true about panera discontinuing french onion soup</p>— ellie!
