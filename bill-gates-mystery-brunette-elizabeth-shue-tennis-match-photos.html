The Microsoft co-founder, 66, was spotted taking in a tennis match on Friday (March 18) while sitting between two gorgeous female friends, one of which was Oscar-nominated actress <strong>Elizabeth Shue</strong>!

His brunette mystery companion to his right was super chic in her all-black ensemble. Meanwhile, Elizabeth, star of such 80s hits as Karate Kid and Adventures in Babysitting, showed off her wild side in an animal print skirt and light brown top. The actress, who has been married to film director <strong>Davis Guggenheim</strong> since 1994, brought along their 21-year-old daughter <strong>Stella</strong>, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Daily Mail</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>The fun-filled outing comes just seven months after Bill’s divorce from his ex <strong>Melinda</strong> was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>finalized</a>. Two days after a Washington judge made the split official, Bill appeared on CNN’s&nbsp;Anderson Cooper 360° to express regret over the cheating scandal surrounding the divorce. “Certainly, I think everyone does [have regrets],” he said about his affair with a Microsoft employee that ended years ago. “But it’s a time of reflection and at this point I need to go forward. My work is very important to me. Within the family we’ll heal as best we can and learn from what happened.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/bill-gates-tennis-ss-post2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Bill first owned up to the affair&nbsp;in&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a statement</a>&nbsp;to the&nbsp;Wall Street Journal last year after it was reported he was leaving the board at Microsoft. “There was an affair almost 20 years ago which ended amicably,” a spokesperson reported. “Bill’s decision to transition off the board was in no way related to this matter. In fact, he had expressed an interest in spending more time on his philanthropy starting several years earlier.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Bill and Melinda were married in 1994 and share three kids: son <strong>Rory</strong>&nbsp;<strong>John</strong>, 22, and daughters&nbsp;<strong>Phoebe</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Adele</strong>, 18, and&nbsp;<strong>Jennifer</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Katharine</strong>, 25.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH10e5ByZpuhnKF6qK3Tnqpmpamowaa%2B2GaZq62emsG1sYyeo6KykZeytbSMrJ%2BunV2psq%2B6yKxkppmkmLVuvMeoq6irXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
