It was empty, everyone was just staring.</p><p>"I’m first thinking it was a shark attack, because I did hear there was a shark attack a few weeks back."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><p>Luke says the boat operator then told him that one person had been pulled from the water and one was still missing.</p><p>He explained: "As he's told me that, we looked up to the sea and the 17-year-old was being pulled out. The ambulance came across and collected him.</p><p>"Nothing really affects me but when it’s something like that it kind of hits you.</p><p>"Especially as I was with the family, my little one especially, I wanted to get out of there."</p><p>According to the website Marine&nbsp;Traffic, the boat had visited Bournemouth Pier at 4pm, just minutes before the first 999 calls were made.</p><p>The Dorset Belle has the capacity to take 80 passengers on £15 pleasure trips around Poole Bay and Poole Harbour.</p><p>According to its Facebook page, the sea conditions around Bournemouth pier on Wednesday morning were said to be too dangerous for it to sail.</p><p>A statement on the page stated: "The sea conditions at Bournemouth pier are set to improve this afternoon..so we are planning of (sic) carry out at 16.00, 17.00, 18.00 & 19.00 round the bay...once we are happy with our berthing trial."</p><p>It comes after it emerged cops were probing whether the&nbsp;<a href=#>wash from a boat</a>&nbsp;could have caused the tragic kids to get into difficulty.</p><p>MP&nbsp;Conor Burns&nbsp;said he understood that a "surface vessel" was in the sea around Bournemouth Pier at the time of the&nbsp;horror.</p><p>He said: "It would seem not a far reach to draw a conclusion that while the vessel may not have physically touched the young people perhaps it created the conditions which made being in the water more dangerous by the speed it was going."</p><p>The victims were among 10 youngsters who got into difficulty while&nbsp;<a href=#>swimming</a>&nbsp;in the sea around the Victorian pier.</p><p>Desperate attempts to resuscitate the boy and girl were carried out on the beach before they were airlifted to&nbsp;<a href=#>hospital</a>&nbsp;where they were later pronounced dead.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>The girl was from the Buckinghamshire area and was visiting Bournemouth at the time.
