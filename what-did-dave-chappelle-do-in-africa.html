Fans didn't know it, but the former Comedy Central staple purposely stepped away from the public eye by traveling under the radar to South Africa.</p><p>As reports, Dave talked about his decision during a 2014 appearance on <a href=#>David Letterman's show</a>. Not only did he admit to wanting to dodge the media, but he also opened up about his semi-regret losing out on making the huge <a href=#>amount of money</a> he could have earned during his self-imposed work hiatus.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Although Dave notes he got to spend time with <a href=#>his family</a> during his time away from Hollywood, he added, "It makes no sense at all. There’s nothing anyone can say. It’s just you do what you feel like you need to do. It’s a very complicated answer, because I felt a variety of ways over the last years."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Addressing his financial loses, Dave said, "Whenever there’s something I’d like to have that I could have afforded but I can’t now afford, then I’m upset about it. But then when I see a guy who goes to a job that’s time consuming and he doesn’t have free time to do things I get to do, then I feel good about it."</p><p>But Dave confessed that there's a currency other than cash that makes him tick, and it seems that is what he was exploring in Africa.</p><p>Meanwhile, there's even more to the story!</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Dave Chappelle talked to Oprah about why going to South Africa was what he needed.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>In addition to opening up to David, <a href=#>Oprah</a> was another host who managed to get Dave to chat about his sabbatical to Africa. As speculation mounted that the comedian was mentally ill or addicted to drugs, he told the real story to the famous talk show star.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"One, I needed a break," Dave explained to Oprah, although he also shared that even <a href=#>his wife</a> didn't know he was going to Africa, a decision he later called a "crazy mistake."</p><p>He then detailed, "Two, we have family and friends down there. I felt like it was a place where I could really reflect... And here's the other thing: I was only gone for two weeks! They made it sound like it was so mysterious."</p><p>Dave also stated that he didn't feel as in control over the increasingly "socially irresponsible" content as Chappelle Show went into subsequent seasons. "I knew I was going to leave. The only reason I didn't leave sooner was because I knew they were going to say, 'He couldn't finish his show.' So I got ahead of schedule, and I bounced," he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIydoJ1llJbDpnnCoZipqJWhuaZ5w6hkoqZdlrOztcKa</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
