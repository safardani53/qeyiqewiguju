Football fans typically frown upon the mere mention of a break during the club football season. However, thanks to the FIFA World Cup qualifiers, fans all over the world now have a reason to tune in to international matches.</p><h2>The results of the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifiers have been astounding.</h2><p>The 2022 World Cup qualifiers are nearing completion. Dominant teams such as Germany and Brazil have put on spectacular performances during the qualifying phase and have already secured their places in the World Cup. On the other hand, many unexpected teams have qualified for the World Cup.</p><p>Serbia stunned the football world by defeating Portugal 2-1 on Matchday 10 to earn direct qualification to next year’s World Cup at the expense of Cristiano Ronaldo’s squad. This article will go over five such teams that have outperformed expectations during the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifiers:</p><h2>Number 5:&nbsp; Mali</h2><p><strong>Mali</strong> has performed admirably in the FIFA World Cup qualifiers. They finished first in Group E with 16 points from six games. The African country has advanced to the final round of qualifiers, which will be held in March of next year. Five of the ten teams in the final round will advance to the FIFA World Cup in Qatar in 2022.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Mali.jpg><p>Mali is just one step away from qualifying for their first FIFA World Cup. The West African country has scored 11 goals in six games, averaging nearly two goals per game. On the other end of the spectrum, they have not conceded a single goal in any FIFA World Cup qualifier match.</p><p>They went into the international break knowing that a win would guarantee their place in the final qualification round, and they delivered by defeating Rwanda 3-0. Ibrahima Kone has been their leading scorer, with five goals in five games.</p><h2>Number 4: Saudi Arabia</h2><p>Among Asian teams, <strong>Saudi Arabia</strong>‘s performances in the FIFA World Cup qualifiers are unquestionably noteworthy. After five games, they have a one-point lead in Group B. Given the presence of Australia and Japan in the group, this is a huge accomplishment for the Middle Eastern country.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Saudi-Arabia.jpg><p>Saudi Arabia has only lost two points so far. Except for the stalemate against Australia, they have won all of their games, most notably defeating Japan, a country ranked far higher in the FIFA World Rankings than they are.</p><p>They have also scored the most goals in both Asian qualifying groups, with three Saudi Arabia players tied for second place with two goals each in the FIFA World Cup qualifiers. Despite having a three-point lead over second-placed Australia, Asia’s FIFA World Cup qualifiers still have a long way to go.</p><h2>Number 3: Ecuador</h2><p>Many football fans did not expect Ecuador to finish third in the FIFA World Cup qualifiers. The South American team has been outstanding, and they currently lead Chile, Colombia, and Uruguay by four points.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Ecuador.jpg><p><strong>Ecuador</strong>, which did not qualify for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, is in a strong position to gain direct qualification this time. Their attack has been the talk of the town, with 21 goals in 13 games. They’ve beaten Colombia 6-1 and Uruguay 4-2.</p><p>While Ecuador has had a relatively easy time in the FIFA World Cup qualifiers, they will face Chile, Brazil, and Argentina in three of their next five games. Their four-point lead over the chasing pack should be enough to ensure they qualify.</p><h2>Number 2: Switzerland</h2><p><strong>Switzerland</strong> made headlines yesterday when they won the FIFA World Cup qualifiers Group C. Throughout the qualifiers, they were consistent in both attack and defense, and they earned a spot in next year’s World Cup.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Switzerland.jpg><p>Switzerland finished ahead of European champions Italy, which is quite remarkable. Both teams had 15 points when their final group game began last night. Switzerland defeated Bulgaria 4-0, while Italy failed to score and was forced to share the spoils with Northern Ireland.</p><p>Despite an attacking masterclass in Luzern, Switzerland’s defense has been outstanding in FIFA World Cup qualifiers. No one in their right mind would have bet against Italy winning the group, but the Granit Xhaka-captained team pulled it off.</p><h2>Number 1: Serbia</h2><p>During the FIFA World Cup qualifiers, <strong>Serbia</strong> has been the most significant surprise package. Despite being placed in the same group as Portugal, Dusan Tadic’s team defied the odds and went undefeated. Serbia finished the qualifiers with 20 points from eight Group A matches.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Serbia.jpg><p>On Sunday, the crucial result that determined Group A’s fate was announced. Portugal and Serbia faced off in Lisbon, both on 17 points. Despite being the odds-on favorites, Serbia won the match 2-1.</p><p>Tadic scored near the half-hour mark to cancel out Renato Sanches’ opener, then set up Aleksandar Mitrovic for the late winner. Mitrovic’s eighth goal in the FIFA World Cup qualifiers lifted Serbia above Portugal in the group, securing their place in next year’s World Cup.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGidop6RYsSwvsudZJytoGK%2Btq3Lop2inaKofA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
