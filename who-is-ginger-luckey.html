The politician, 39, who is currently under <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>investigation for his alleged relationship</a> with a 17-year-old girl, and his fiancée <strong>Ginger Luckey</strong> eloped in California over the weekend after dating for about a year. Both bride and groom shared snapshots from their <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>big day on social media</a> on Saturday, Aug. 21.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>The nuptials come amid the ongoing federal investigation against the <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Donald Trump</strong></a> ally to determine whether he had sexual relations with a minor and paid for her travels. New <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>court filings from last month</a> revealed that the congressman’s campaign has been shelling out more spending amid the investigation, with half of which going towards attorney <strong>Marc Fernich</strong>, who has repped the late <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jeffrey Epstein</strong>.&nbsp;</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Within all the legal clamor and the clangor, the congressman has factored in time to exchange vows with Ginger, 26. Below are five things to know about the politician’s new wife.</p><h2><strong>Ginger Met Her Husband At Trump’s Mar-A-Lago</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>Ginger told the Daily Mail last December that she <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>met her Republican congressman</a> husband at the former president’s Mar-a-Lago club — the same location in which he would propose — in Palm Beach, Florida in March 2020. Donald threw a fundraiser at the time, and Ginger said her mother “dragged” her to the event. The following night, Ginger accompanied her future husband to the birthday party of <strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Donald Trump Jr</a>.</strong>’s girlfriend <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kimberly Guilfoyle</strong></a>. Of the proposal, she told the outlet: “It didn’t come as a surprise. I had sort of seen it coming.”</p><h2><strong>Ginger Is A Student At Harvard Business School&nbsp;</strong></h2><p lang=en dir=ltr>The shadows prove the sunshine 💛🌴🍍 <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/Fs0BOUNsMN</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-6>— Ginger Luckey (@LuckeyGinger) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>August 21, 2021</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-8>According to her <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>LinkedIn</a>, Ginger is currently a student at Harvard Business School Online, where she is studying sustainable business strategy. She previously studied economics and accounting at the University of Santa Barbara between 2012 and 2016. Currently, Ginger works as a food analyst for the company Apeel in Santa Barbara in California. She’s been with the company since last year.</p><h2><strong>Ginger’s Brother Is A Known Millionaire & Big Republican Donor</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>Ginger is the sister of <strong>Palmer Luckey,</strong> an entrepreneur best known as the founder of virtual reality company Oculus VR and designer of the Oculus Rift. <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Facebook bought Oculus VR</a> back in 2014 for a reported $2 billion. Forbes estimated that the entrepreneur’s net worth was well over $500 million following the sale, but it is unclear how much he is worth now. He is also an ardent donor to the Republican Party, per <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>OpenSecrets</a>, a research and government transparency group that tracks money in politics. Last October, Palmer hosted a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>fundraiser for President Trump</a> after having reportedly donating thousands to his 2016 campaign.</p><h2><strong>Ginger’s Sister Has Called Matt A “Creep”&nbsp;</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>Don’t call the Luckey family’s support for Republican candidates a family affair, as Ginger’s sister <strong>Roxanne</strong> has <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>slammed her now brother-in-law</a> as a “creep.” Roxanne has been critical of the politician and the allegations of sex trafficking leveled against him, having shared TikToks that recounted stories about him. In one, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Roxanne alleged that Matt tried</a> to set her up with an older friend when she was 19. “I saw the character and type of person he is, and when everything came out about him, I honestly, unfortunately, was not surprised,” she said of the ongoing investigation. “As someone who has personally experienced a ton of creepy old politician men hitting on me when I was underage, and experiencing sexual assault at that age by people of power, it’s very disheartening and I have zero tolerance of people like [Gaetz].”</p><h2><strong>Ginger Doesn’t Live In The Same State As Her Husband</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-11>As her work information suggests, Ginger lives in California, while her husband resides in Florida. In her interview with Daily Mail, Ginger revealed that since her job had gone remote due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, however, she has been traveling full-time with her “travel buddy” husband. “My company went totally remote in March so I can do my financial analytics from anywhere,” she told the outlet. “So I have been traveling with him everywhere. I am his travel buddy.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH15e5FrZrCgn2K2tHnGoqWgnaJiubavyp6waA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
