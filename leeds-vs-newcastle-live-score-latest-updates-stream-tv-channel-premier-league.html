A home fan confronted Newcastle boss Eddie Howe on the touchline as the visitors pressed for a winner.
Stewards dragged the man away and Kristensen's goal proved to be the last of a tumultuous game.
The home side looked dead and buried when Callum Wilson scored his second penalty of the afternoon to put Newcastle 2-1 ahead."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

They remain in the bottom three and in big trouble.</p><p>But Kristensen at least gave them&nbsp; - and Allardyce - hope.</p><p>The fever-pitch atmosphere before kick-off had the desired effect on the home team.</p><p>Leeds players flew into challenges straight from kick-off and within seven minutes, they put the ball into the Newcastle net.</p><p>Good work by Patrick Bamford and Jack Harrison down the left ended with Bamford curling in a cross. Nick Pope saved Rodrigo’s header but pushed the ball into the path of Ayling, who scooped it home.</p><p>The home fans turned the volume up to 12 and Newcastle had failed the first test of any visit to Elland Road: neuter the crowd.</p><p>The pace of the game remained frenetic, leading to plenty of errors on the ball from both sides.</p><p>The visitors had more of the ball but did not do a lot with it.</p><p>When Kieran Trippier beat the offside trap to volley a first-time ball across the penalty area, Callum Wilson was caught on his heels and the Leeds defence cleared.</p><p>Then came Bamford’s latest soul-crushing moment of a difficult season.</p><p>Junior Firpo burst into the box and Joelinton committed the silliest of fouls to concede the clearest of penalties.</p><p>The home fans sang Bamford’s name as he stepped up to take the spotkick. But they were soon cursing it as his weak attempt was saved pretty comfortably by Pope, diving to this right, and the Newcastle goalkeeper scooped the rebound away for a corner.</p><p>All too soon for those in white, Wilson showed Bamford and Leeds how it should be done.</p><p>Isak ran on to Bruno Guimaraes’ pass, Firpo slipped and Max Wober went right through the Swede to give away another blatant penalty.</p><p>Wilson buried the kick in the bottom left corner of the net.</p><p>Newcastle had finally burst the home crowd’s bubble, and roars of support began to be replaced by howls of frustration.</p><p>Miguel Almiron, restored to the Newcastle starting 11, delayed a cross from a good position long enough for it to be cleared behind.</p><p>Leeds posed little threat until Bamford teed up Sam Greenwood, but the midfielder skewed his shot high and wide.</p><p>There was no shortage of needle. After Almiron had shot wide, Ayling and Dan Burn were in each other’s faces in first-half stoppage-time and the feeling grew that someone was going to see red at some point.</p><p>Allardyce replaced Greenwood with Adam Forshaw at half time for a crucial 45 minutes in Leeds’ season.</p><p>They started on the front foot and Bamford’s lay-off almost worked out for Forshaw.</p><p>At the other end, Wilson lashed a shot well off target and went down claiming a foul, not for the first time.</p><p>Some more tough tackling and commitment roused the home fans again.</p><p>Newcastle were pushing for the breakthrough, with Kieran Trippier causing problems with crosses, but also leaving themselves exposed a little on the break.&nbsp;</p><p>Bruno Guimaraes was booked for diving but was then fouled by Firpo, whose reckless lunge was looked at by VAR but not deemed bad enough to upgrade his yellow card to a red.</p><p>The same lack of composure remained evident when both teams were on the ball. At the crucial moment, passes or shots were going astray, with Leeds midfielder Weston McKennie the latest to fire off target.</p><p>Wilfried Gnonto received a warm welcome when he replaced Harrison with more than 25 minutes to go.</p><p>But Firpo’s second moment of madness soon arrived.</p><p>As the left back retreated to try to stop Joe Willock’s cross reaching Alexander Isak, he stretched his left arm high above his head and made contact with the ball.</p><p>Once referee Simon Hooper had been called over to look at the monitor, there was only going to be one outcome.</p><p>This time Wilson hit his penalty straight down the middle and the Newcastle bench celebrated almost as wildly as the travelling support.</p><p>Substitute Allan Saint-Maximin had a third goal ruled out for offside against Isak in the build-up but things still looked desperate for Leeds.</p><p>Then came that little bit of luck you need in such situations.</p><p>After Bamford had two efforts blocked, Kristensen swung his right boot and the ball took a wicked deflection off Trippier on its way past Pope.</p><p>Joel Robles made a comfortable enough save from Saint-Maximin but Firpo caused more anxiety.</p><p>He brought down substitute Anthony Gordon on the edge of the box and received the second yellow card he richly deserved.</p><p>But as a home fan confronted Howe on the touchline, Trippier’s free kick was blocked.</p><p>Robles saved from Schar and Leeds managed to hold on for the point.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/leeds-uniteds-junior-firpo-handles-817154782.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/newcastle-uniteds-callum-wilson-scores-817146479.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/scores-opening-goal-english-premier-817143477.jpg><p class=has-text-align-center><strong><a href=#>CASINO SPECIAL - BEST ONLINE CASINOS FOR 2023</a></strong></p><p>See how all the action from Elland Road unfolded...</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZH9zfpdxamptX6GyprDSZq2sZZ6axKSt0q2jnmWcnsOmedKcpqudXaGutbHSrWSuqJSWwaa%2FjKyrq52Ronq1woycn5qmnpq5brzRnqSinaJiuaatxq6caA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
