The 2 Broke Girls alum tied the knot with “Party Hard” rocker <strong>Andrew W.K.</strong> two years after they went public with their romance. Here’s what else you should know about the musician, actor, activist, multi-hyphenate whom Kat calls her husband.</p><h2>His Single ‘Party Hard’ Made Him A Star</h2><p id=content-paragraph-3>Andrew came onto the scene in 2001 with “Party Hard,” the essential anthem for, well, partying until the crack of dawn. His debut album I Get Wet featured a now iconic cover, a photo of Andrew, drenched in sweat, with a massive bloody nose dripping down his shirt. Twenty years later, he’s still dedicated to wearing the same white tee and white jeans combo during performances and appearances. While “Party Hard” is his best-known song, he’s also popular for “She Is Beautiful,” “We Want Fun” and more.</p><h2>Andrew Is Married to Kat Dennings</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>It’s unclear how long Kat and Andrew have actually been together, but they began tagging each other in photos sharing PDA online in mid-2021. Kat shared a dreamy photo of Andrew in a tight black tee to Instagram first, captioning the post with a black heart. Fans really started freaking out when the twosome both posted a photo of themselves <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>kissing</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>During a 2023 interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Vogue</a>, Kat revealed that she and Andrew had proposed to each other shortly after meeting for the first time.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“About three years ago, Andrew had come to visit me for the first time.

It quickly became obvious that we were made for each other.”</p><h2>Andrew Is Also a Motivational Speaker</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>Back in 2005, Andrew embarked on a self-help tour at colleges throughout the United States, including Yale, NYU, the University of Wisconsin, Carnegie Mellon University, the Cooper Union, Missouri Western State University and Northeastern University. He turned his popular, wholesome motivational appearances into a column for the famed <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Village Voice.</a></p><h2>He Used to Have a Popular Advice Column</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>“Ask Andrew W.K.” ran in the Village Voice from 2014 to 2015. Andrew was tasked with helping advice-seekers about anything from roommate issues, to romantic dilemmas, or just quandaries about the best way to party hard. Andrew’s advice was sincere and well thought out. Only he could <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>take a question like</a> “Why are they called the Democratic ‘Party’ and Republican ‘Party’ when these politicians are the last people I would want to party with?” and turn it into a passionate essay about bipartisanship.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Andrew-W.K.-5-Things-SS-embed.jpg><h2>Andrew Hosted His Own Game Show</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Destroy Build Destroy</a> aired on Cartoon Network for four seasons, beginning in 2009.
