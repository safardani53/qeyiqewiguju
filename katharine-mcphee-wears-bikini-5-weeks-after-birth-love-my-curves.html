“Loving my curves because my baby gave them to me,” the American Idol alum, 37, captioned a Tuesday, March 30, mirror selfie. The singer matched her sunglasses to her brown swimsuit in the Instagram upload, accessorizing with gold earrings.

I’m in trouble, but hopefully, hopefully my husband will not be too mad. … We don’t want to be that pretentious over the name, but it’s the only kind of thing you can hold on to that feels private.”</p><p>The “original” moniker came to the couple “two hours before [their son] was born.” McPhee explained the inspiration behind it, telling Cagle, 55: “It’s a really great family name, but one of [Foster’s] family members didn’t tell us about it until hours before he was born. It sort of took my breath away. I was waiting for something like that, and I just didn’t think it would happen. We were going to name him something totally different, which was a great name, but not something that meant something.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>News broke in October 2020 that the Smash alum was <a href=#>expecting her first child</a>, one year after she and the Grammy winner<a href=#> tied the knot in London</a>.
