Webley posted a series of videos gauding his enemies weeks before he was gunned down on Hogmanay.
The first shows him walking on the street in Edinburgh wearing a Christmas t-shirt which reads “Ho-Ho no”. He is also carrying a “man bag” which he hints has a weapon inside.
Webley brazenly says: “What’s in the man bag, come and find out."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

F*****g balloons. Come and get it, tick tick f***** boom, haha.</p><p>“Stop shooting windows ya fat p**f.”</p><p>He recorded another outside a boozer where he taunts his rivals to come and get him.</p><p>He says: “You could’ve come to the pub.

A good advantage.</p><p>“I don’t see it though. No honestly I don’t. Probably get me a wee tuppence. And you get a strike, that ends the show.</p><p>“We were brought up with stab wounds.

Thing is the other guy was in Spain when this happened.</p><p>“Webley left the Anchor Inn just before the bells and was shot outside. It seems like it was by someone waiting who knew he’d be there.</p><p>"Webley is a regular in there so it was fair to assume he’d be there on Hogmanay."</p><p>His Lotto winning ex Jane Park <a href=#>posted a heartfelt message</a> stating she was absolutely devastated.</p><p>She posted a picture of her with Webley to her Instagram account, saying: &nbsp;"I can't believe I'm writing this. We spoke yesterday.</p><p>"If I could cuddle you again and tell you everything is going to be ok, I would give anything to do it Marc.</p><p>"The months we spent together you taught me some valuable things in life and I'll never ever forget you. I am absolutely devastated."</p><p>Murder cops launched a probe into the killing yesterday.</p><p>Detective Superintendent Graham Grant said: “This is believed to have been a targeted incident and our thoughts and condolences are with the family and friends of both men involved.</p><p>“Enquiries are at a very early stage to establish the full circumstances surrounding what happened, and while officers have already gathered CCTV and spoken to various people who were in the area at the time, I’d urge anyone with information who hasn’t yet spoken to us to come forward.</p><p>“In particular if anyone has private CCTV, doorbell footage or dashcam of the Granton Crescent/Road area around the time of the incident, please bring it to our attention.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>“This incident will undoubtedly have caused concern in the local community and officers will be carrying out extra patrols of the area and I’d like to reassure the public that everything possible is being done to trace whoever is responsible.”</p><p>"Anyone with information is urged to call 101 quoting reference 3819 of 31 December.
