Fortunately, the answer is a lot simpler than many think.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">First, let's look at the events leading up to Margaret Josephs' injury.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bravo</span></figure><p>If you recall during the very first episode of Season 13, <a href=#>Melissa Gorga</a> hosted an '80s-themed rollerskating party to kick off Memorial Day weekend. To celebrate, <a href=#>the castmates and their husbands</a> got all dressed up in their best '80s gear, featuring neon leotards, super high ponytails, and — of course — LOTS of spandex.</p><p>The Real Housewives crew enjoyed getting to know each other in a new way. Margaret even divulged some interesting info about her younger self, sharing that this was far from her first rodeo at a roller rink.</p><p>"I would wear my high-heeled Candies shoes, heavy black eyeliner, go to the roller rink, do a double session, and then meet my boyfriend after and have sex," she shared on the show.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Despite the tensions between the castmates, Margaret's injury did not come a fellow 'RHONJ' star.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Melissa Gorga (@melissagorga)</a></p></figure><p>For the most part, the party was a success, minus the awkward tensions in the room, of course. Aside from the beef between castmates Dolores Catania and Jennifer Aydin, the long-standing feud between sister-in-laws <a href=#>Melissa Gorga and Teresa Giudice</a> was looming over the entire event.</p><p>Melissa is still pretty peeved about Teresa not choosing her to be a bridesmaid in <a href=#>her wedding</a> to Digital Media Solutions cofounder Luis Ruelas.</p><p>"Picking one person, who is your only brother's wife, and saying 'I'm gonna exclude you,' is a big f you," Melissa remarked in a confessional. And as a result, she and her husband opted to skip out on attending the wedding altogether.</p><p>Not that it mattered much to Teresa, who said she was "totally fine" with them not coming.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a><p>Margaret Josephs and Melissa Gorga</p></figure><p>But Melissa wasn't the only one Giudice had beef with. Tensions were also high between her and Margaret, who she hadn't spoken to since the <a href=#>Season 12 reunion</a>.</p><p>But that wasn't the only buzzkill.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, what happened to Margaret's arm — and why is she still wearing a cast?</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Margaret Josephs (@therealmargaretjosephs)</a></p></figure><p>During the party, Margaret fell and fractured her wrist, hence the shiny new cast fans have been speculating about.</p><p>But fans of the Real Housewives diva shouldn't worry. The star reassured viewers that she can still handle the important tasks.</p><p>“I can wipe my a- with my left hand,” she quipped.</p><p>Plus, there's another silver lining in this story considering she and Teresa decided to make amends following her injury.</p><p>Luckily, Margaret's arm has seemingly healed, as it is nowhere in sight on her most recent photos on her Instagram page. However, along with <a href=#>Heather Gay's black eye</a> on RHOSLC and 'RHOM's Adriana de Moura's "broken foot," we have a feeling this won't be the last injury on the Bravo franchise.</p><p>Watch The Real Housewives of New Jersey Tuesdays at 8 p.m. EST on Bravo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSmmaKcrrOx02ahqKuVpbW0ecCrpGaqmKS7qw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
