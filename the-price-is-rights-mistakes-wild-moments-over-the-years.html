Former longtime host Bob Barker made a rookie mistake during a 1984 episode accidentally telling a contestant named Albert the correct answer before the game was even finished. While playing Pick-A-Pair, Albert was tasked with figuring out which products cost the same price as a can of chili, which ran for $1."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

While playing Pick-A-Pair, Albert was tasked with figuring out which products cost the same price as a <a href=#>can of chili</a>, which ran for $1.59 at the time. On his first attempt, he incorrectly guessed.</p><p>“Do you know which one of them is $1.59? The raisins,” Barker — who began <a href=#>hosting the game show</a> in 1972 — said, not realizing his blunder. “The raisins are $1.59. Do you know how I know they’re $1.59?”</p><p>After realizing his mistake, Barker stopped himself and laughed, noting that Albert should have a “pretty good chance of winning” now, <a href=#>which made the audience chuckle</a>.</p><p>“Don’t stand there and laugh at me,” he quipped. “I’m making a fool of myself, Albert. I’ve been here for all these years, playing this game. You know it well enough, you knew that I was goofing.”</p><p>After Barker retired in 2007, <a href=#><strong>Drew Carey</strong></a> was <a href=#>named his successor</a> to the game show. In his second season of hosting, the former Whose Line Is It Anyway? host was faced with a <a href=#>near-scandal</a> that never aired.</p><p>In the game of Plinko, contestants try to drop chips down a maze-like board, hoping to land them in the coveted $10,000 slot. While appearing on <a href=#>SiriusXM’s Jeff and Larry’s Comedy Roundup</a> show in February 2021, the Drew Carey Show alum recalled an instance where <a href=#>one contestant got a little too lucky</a>.</p><p>“There’s a college girl that got to play Plinko, and she dropped her first three chips right down in the $10,000 spot,” he said, noting that she had beaten a previous record. “People were on their feet, jumping up and down and cheering. I mean, the crowd was going wild. She dropped the fourth chip, the floor director comes over, stops the chip, and leans into me and he goes, ‘The game is fixed.’”</p><p>While Carey worried the <a href=#>potential scandal</a> was going to cost him his job, he learned the snafu was an honest mistake. Before the season had begun filming, the game board was used to film a commercial for an upcoming Price Is Right-themed <a href=#>video game</a>. The machine was rigged with a fishing line so the chips would land in the $10,000 spot every time.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Carey went on to explain that the contestant was <a href=#>awarded $30,000</a> behind the scenes that didn’t count towards her grand-prize total and gave her a new set of Plinko chips to try again.</p><p>Keep scrolling to see some of the other biggest mistakes on the Price Is Right over the years:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BptaZ5z6ugnJ1dnsBuvsign62rXaK2tMDApJysZaeeuaV5zKiknqakqHqwwsSrZK2glWLGpq3RrGY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
