In April, Sanya exclusively hinted to Us Weekly that the pair have plans to expand their family.</p><p>“[There are] lots of new developments with baby No. 2,” the Olympian exclusively told Us. “This season and a lot that I think a lot of women and families will be able to relate to as Ross and I are still navigating this conversation and the possibilities of what our family will look like.”</p><p>Sanya admitted that she and Aaron had their “entire family” living with them at the time and the talks of a second child halted due. However, she explained their brood had plans to “be moving out soon” and the discussions of having another baby were open.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/The-Real-Housewives-of-Atlanta-Star-Sanya-Richards-Ross-Is-Pregnant-With-Baby-No.-2-235.jpg><p>“Is it the right time for baby number two? Just all of these things that I think, you know, we’re all always trying to figure out and make the best decision,” she said. “So that’s a big part of this season for me is baby number two and my extended family living with me.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Before sharing the exciting news, Sanya opened up about her struggles with <a href=#>balancing her marriage and motherhood</a>.</p><p>“Ross and I struggled with [being parents] in the first couple years of our marriage,” she recalled to <a href=#>The Bump</a> in February. “I nursed my son for almost two and a half years. A nurse — and I wish I had taken her advice — told me to pump. She said, ‘You have to share this load. If you’re exclusively breastfeeding, it’s going to get overwhelming.’ And I remember, there were days when I would ask my husband to just stay up with me. Even if he wasn’t feeding, I just needed his company. And he was like, “Why should we both be tired,” and it caused a big rift.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGaroJ%2BWwG6%2FwKewmmWinrCprdGdqmaqn6jAbrXSZqernZejrq%2FAjLCgraBdl66jxYynpmZqXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
