Chris Johnston, 46, moved into his £450,000 Redrow property in Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire, in March last year with wife Louise, 40, and his 12-year-old daughter.
But he quickly found a catalogue of snags, including a staircase which was &#34;falling to pieces&#34; and two-inch long chips in the bathroom."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

That is how&nbsp;bad it is if I am honest.&nbsp;</p><p>"There would be a for sale sign on my front door if I wasn't tied into a mortgage.</p><p>"This is the shoddiest house I have ever been in.

We have had every single trade out to attend to every single room.</p><p>"We are embarrassed to ask friends and family over."</p><p>On moving in, the family quickly discovered a &nbsp;leak in the ensuite bathroom.</p><p>Redrow claimed it was an old issue which had been fixed and painted over the damp spot - but when the problem persisted Chris called a plumber out again.</p><p>He said: "A week later it was still there. They had to put a hole in the ceiling and patched it up.</p><p>"But a week later I noticed the patch getting bigger."</p><p>Chris arranged for a third expert to come out and inspect the area.</p><p>"They put another hole in the ceiling and me and a different plumber found a leak coming from the boiler", he added.</p><p>"How they missed that the first time I don't know."</p><p>And that's not the only problem he faced with the property's four bathrooms.</p><p>"They have had to rip out every single bathroom since we have been in here for various reasons.</p><p>"There was chipped sanitaryware, the chips in the sink are two inches long.</p><p>"I have a twelve year old girl in here that I was trying to home school&nbsp;with workmen here."</p><p>Chris - an operations manager for an accident repair centre - also said the staircase was "falling to pieces&nbsp;on the ground level".</p><p>He added: "Redrow asked us to move out for two weeks in lockdown. They had to rip the staircase out and put a new one in.</p><p>"We had to go to stay with inlaws in&nbsp;France, I have no family in this country.</p><p>"We came back and they caused more damage than they fixed.
