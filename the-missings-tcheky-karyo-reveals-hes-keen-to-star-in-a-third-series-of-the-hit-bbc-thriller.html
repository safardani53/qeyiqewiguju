And I was so proud and grateful to the Williams brothers to give me such a mission as an actor. I’m really touched because they had a lot of confidence in me.</p><p>“I felt excited, there was no pressure at all.</p><p>It was very stimulating. They are so talented, and it’s always surprising the way they write their stories, with all the twists.”</p><p>Ah yes, the twists. The audience aren’t the only ones who have had to keep up with the drama’s revelations and jumps in time.</p><p>“It was a challenge,” smiles Tchéky. “The script supervisor and the brothers did a complete chronology of events from 1991 onwards, so we could always know where we were – and also play with the mystery and the secrets. Sometimes we did get lost.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/12249035-high.jpg><p>However, Tchéky knows it’s this scattergun way that The Missing’s plot unfolds that creates such an unusual experience for viewers.</p><p>“I realised from social media that the audience are becoming investigators themselves,” he says.</p><p>“There is a real interaction with it, it’s very witty. The writers don’t think the audience is stupid, they have a brain. That’s why I pay a lot of respect to them, they raise things up.”</p><p>Five million people a week have been riveted by Alice Webster’s abduction and her mysterious ‘return’ – and as the series reaches its climax, the race is on for Julien to find abductor Adam Gettrick (Derek Riddell).</p><p>No spoilers here, but TV Magazine is dying to know whether this run will reach a more definite conclusion than the first, where the plot was left hanging in the air.</p><p>“Yes, it does,” confirms Tchéky, before adding: “There is also a big question mark about how, eventually, a third season could happen.”</p><p>So Julien might come back for another case?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/12196982-high.jpg><p>“Possibly,” Tchéky teases. “I would love to do a third series. I love the character and I love the complicity between the BBC and the writers. There’s something graceful about this show.”</p><p>Although he speaks fluent English, the actor and musician admits working in a language other than his native French can be tricky.</p><p>“I was lucky to have a great voice coach to ‘wear the gloves’ with me,” he explains.</p><p>“I always think an actor is like an athlete – so, like an athlete, you have a sparring partner who puts on the gloves with you and you knock it around. She can listen when I go crazy on the character and try all sorts of things.</p><p>“There is more work to do when it’s in English – but if the script was in French, I would still have a lot of work to do.”</p><p>Over more than 30 years, Tchéky has worked extensively in France and is quite famous there – “people know me, but I’m not a star” – but working on a major BBC1 series has seriously boosted his profile in Britain.</p><p>“In a short time, a lot of Twitter followers came,” he smiles. “Some nice tweets, some funny ones. There was a tweet saying: ‘If Julien Baptiste dies, there will be a riot!’”</p><p>And coming to London to publicise the show means one thing – dealing with cabbies’ quips.</p><p>Tchéky laughs: “Every time I get a taxi, they always ask me: ‘How’s the limp?’”</p><p><strong>LAST EPISODE! The Missing Wednesday 9pm BBC1; the series so far is available on BBC iPlayer until Tuesday</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2tmqaUqLWww8GisWhqYmqDd3%2BXaKuhnV2itrS%2FyKeerGWkmLWmt9hmopqqqaR6s7HVnpilq12dsrR5yp6cp2WkpHq0wMCrZKKmXZZ6tbTIq5tmq5Wntqa%2FjKidZqyYmnqptdNmmZubXam1s7XLpZyrZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
