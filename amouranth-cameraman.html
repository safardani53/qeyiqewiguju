The streamer experiences the fallout of her marital-status reveal.</h2><p>Many details about Amouranth's marriage have come to light since her initial stream. In several follow-up broadcasts, she has revealed how far the toxicity in her life has spread. As reported by outlets like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Metro</a>, Amouranth implied she was forced by her husband to create content targeting male viewers and was forbidden to reveal her marital status. She claims that issues were perpetuated by the actions of her cameraman and friend of eight years known as Marz.</p><p>In a recent stream, Amouranth alleged that Marz was aware of the abuse she was experiencing from her husband. The streamer accused her cameraman of being "out of line" in their relationship.</p><p>"He has known me longer than anyone on my staff, so I don't like that he's labeling other people as enablers," Amouranth mentioned on stream. "Because he's know about the situation for so long."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>According to Metro, Amouranth said that Marz contacted police during a fight between her and her husband, which she says exacerbated the argument.</p><p>The situation has since led Amouranth to cut ties with Marz and remove him from her staff completely.
