At one point, Olivia had her cellphone up to her ear and appeared to be chatting with someone as she smiled and kept warm with a jacket that read “USA” down the sleeve draped over her shoulders.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/olivia-jade-black-swan-halloween-mega-post-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Olivia’s latest outing comes in the midst of her headline-making appearances on DWTS. The talented star is teamed up with <strong>Val Chmerkovskiy&nbsp;</strong>and one of their latest dances was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>to “Beggin,”</a> which was inspired by The Purge. Although they’ve sometimes been in the bottom two in certain weeks, their team is still going strong and Olivia is proving she knows how to work hard and gain the skills she needs to possibly win the competition!</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>She spoke with reporters, including <strong>HollywoodLife</strong>, a couple weeks ago after ending in the bottom two and revealed what it was like. “I was whispering to him, I’m like, ‘My anxiety right now is not okay.’ I was just really nervous,” <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Olivia said</a> about standing there and waiting for her results with Val. “I already knew how much I loved being here and then being put in a situation where, in one vote, it could all go away. It was terrifying.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>She also said being in the bottom two has helped “put into perspective though how much I do want to be here” and capped it off by pointing out that “honestly, it’s just those types of moments will push me so much harder and make me want to do even better.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH5xe5JpZqikmau2onnJmpueZZKhrqS3jKyumqZdna6tuM6wnJ6mXZi8tMDUppxmamBnfm68x6irqKtf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
