By that, we can guess that he has been interested in hockey since the very beginning.&nbsp;</p><p>However, he said that it was not what his coach originally wanted. As a kid, his coach made him play as the D-man most of the time and did not let him go into the net.</p><p>So, once the coach left, he was the first guy in the net. Seems like Philipp knew what he exactly wanted and stuck with it.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Wayne Gretzky</strong> is widely recognized to be the best hockey player of all time.

Grubauer has one Stanley Cup with the Capitals, won in 2018.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Philip-Graubauer-with-Stanley-cup-1024x992.jpg><p>In 2018, he was traded to the Colorado Avalanche with a three-year, $10 million contract.</p><p>After the contract ended in 2021, he could not come to terms with the avalanche and opted to move to Seattle Kraken under a six-year, $35.4 million contract.&nbsp;</p><h3>Olympics and International Experience</h3><p>Along with being a top player in the NHL, he has also represented his country Germany in many international games.</p><p>His earlier appearance was at the 2008 world u-17 hockey challenge, where Germany resulted in ninth place. Similarly, as a goaltender, he played in Kazan, Russia’s 2008 IIHF world u18 championship.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2009, he participated in the world junior championship but gained attention at the 2010 championships held in France.</p><p>When the news of Philipp representing Germany in the 2022 winter Olympics was announced, fans were eagerly waiting for him to perform in the Olympic arena.</p><p>After all, competing in the Olympics is a rare chance for every athlete, and it is equally exciting for the fans too.</p><p>However, NHL did not allow the players to attend the Olympics because of a surge of omicron variant of covid.

At 6 feet 1 tall and weight of about 84 kg, Phillip has one of the best physiques in the NHL.&nbsp;However, he has to spend a lot of time working out to keep his body fit and strong.</p><p>Talking about his appearance, his eyes shine bright in the shade of hazel and his hair is a brownish or a dirty blonde.</p><p>According to his professional contract, he is not allowed to do any dangerous sport. So, he is not allowed to ski, ride a motorcycle or parachute. But he has said that the first thing he will do after retiring from hockey is ski.</p><h2>Personal Life and Relationships</h2><p>Despite being a much-loved athlete, Philipp does not like getting attention over him.

They rescued him in 2017 from Kuwait and have had him since then. At first, they took him in as a foster dog for a month, but he immediately grew fond of him and became a permanent home member.</p><p>Leo was previously in an abusive household, so it was hard work to re-socialize him with people and other dogs. Philipp loves taking on challenges and took it upon himself to care for the troubled dog.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Philip-and-his-dog-Leo-1024x1024.jpg><p>The player moved from his home country, Germany to Canada and then to the USA in order to play professional hockey.</p><p>After spending years in Washington DC, Philipp moved to Denver, Colorado, in August 2018.
