Kidman was immediately smitten with the country singer, but Urban <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">took a little longer to come around.</a></p><p>“I remember thinking, I had such a crush on him, and he wasn’t interested in me,” Kidman told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Ellen DeGeneres</strong></a> in 2017. “It’s true! He didn’t call me for four months.”</p><p>However, the “God Whispered Your Name” singer didn’t immediately contact the actress because he wasn’t in the right mindset for a relationship at the time.</p><p>“Somebody had given me her number and I had it in my pocket for a while. I kept looking at it thinking, ‘If I call this number, she’s going to answer. I don’t know what [to] say,'” Urban recalled on the Australian talk show<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Interview</a> in 2018. “I wasn’t in a very healthy place in my life.”</p><p>He added, “I’d never have thought she’d see anything in a guy like me. But, at some point, I plucked up the courage to call those numbers and she answered, and we started talking and we talked and talked and talked and talked and it was effortless.”</p><p>The couple <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">later tied the knot i</a>n June 2006 in a romantic ceremony in Manly, Australia. Kidman and Urban’s wedded bliss was short-lived as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the “Wasted Time” crooner entered rehab </a>in October 2006 after the Bombshell star <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">staged an intervention.</a></p><p>“I caused the implosion of my fresh marriage,” Urban told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rolling Stone</a> in 2016. “It survived, but it’s a miracle it did. I was spiritually awoken with her. I use the expression ‘I was born into her,’ and that’s how I feel. And for the first time in my life, I could shake off the shackles of addiction.”</p><p>Kidman <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">gave birth to their first child</a>, daughter Sunday Rose, in July 2008. Urban and the Moulin Rouge star <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">welcomed their second daughter</a>, Faith Margaret, via surrogate in December 2011. The Oscar winner is also the mother of daughter Isabella and son Conner, whom she adopted with her ex-husband <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Tom Cruise.</strong></a></p><p>The Lion star told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Harper’s Bazaar</a> in 2018 that her marriage has been successful because the couple always make time for each other.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Obviously I work hard, but when I’m off, I’m off,” she explained. “Keith and I are very good at immediately clicking off because we have a really good life in Nashville that’s very simple, quiet and nourishing because we’ve made it like that.”</p><p>Scroll down to see a timeline of their relationship.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNku6qvzqWcZqOZmbqiuoyapZ1lm5q2tbSMrqmbmZ6oerOxy5qroqeeqLWqvIytoKadnJ67pns%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
