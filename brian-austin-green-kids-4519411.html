The actor has <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>five children</a> from three different relationships, and he loves them all so much.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>He met the mother of his eldest son, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Vanessa Marcil</strong></a>, on the set of Beverly Hills, 90210 in 1999. They were engaged in July 2001 and had son <strong>Kassius</strong> in Mar. 2002. However, they split in 2003 before making it down the aisle.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Then, BAG started dating&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Megan Fox</strong></a> in 2004. The relationship had many ups and downs, with babies peppered between break-ups. They were first engaged in 2006, but split three years later only to reconcile in June 2010 with a surprise engagement announcement. The two tied the knot later that month and welcomed their first son in 2012. Another son came in 2014, and another in 2016. After briefly breaking up in 2015, they enjoyed one final reunion before splitting for good in 2020. The divorce was officially finalized the next year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/brian-austin-green-and-sharna-mega-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Brian’s next romance was with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Dancing With the Stars</a> pro,&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Sharna Burgess</strong></a>. The pair began dating in late 2020 and were instantly linked at the hip. They welcomed their own <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>child <strong>Zane</strong></a> in Jun. 2022.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Remarking on his full house with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Entertainment Tonight</a> in July 2022, BAG joked, “I mean, I have five kids, and we joke about the fact that I already had a station wagon, so now I have [to get] a Yukon Denali. If I have another one, then I’m moving to, like, a school bus or something.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>It certainly seems like Brian loves his big brood. Learn everything there is to know about the actor’s five sons here.</p><h2>Kassius Lijah Marcil-Green</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8><strong>Kassius</strong> is Brian’s son with ex Vanessa. He was born on March 15, 2002, making him 20 years old as of 2022. The teenager’s parents were engaged when he was born, but never tied the knot.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Unfortunately, they did not have the most amicable co-parenting relationship after their split. In 2018, Vanessa publicly accused Brian, who was with Megan Fox at the time, of cutting Kassius out of their lives after losing a lawsuit to try and gain full custody of him.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>“Twelve years ago I was served legal papers and then spent 8 years+ defending myself and my son in custody court in response to his father & stepmother trying to get full custody and then asking me to pay them child support,” Vanessa claimed.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>“They lost that case and a civil case asking me for $200,000. I never spoke publicly in order to protect my young son from hearing anything negative about his father and from paparazzi that used to follow him and terrify him. I also never asked for child support of any kind and had never tried to take time away from Kass’ dad seeing him.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>She went on to accuse Brian and Megan of “completely cut[ting] Kass out of their lives and his younger brothers’ lives.” She went on, “He has only seen his dad in passing or in public places. Kass has been truly heartbroken since being cut out of his other family’s lives with no explanation.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>Things seemed to be okay by the summer 2019, when Kassius went to visit his father while he was filming in Canada. Vanessa hinted that they were all on good terms in a Sep. 2020 Instagram post, which said, “My son was finally invited back into his dad’s life and was able to finally meet his youngest brother and finally see his other two siblings again. My son is also an incredible big brother.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>Brian appeared to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>sour on Vanessa</a> by Oct. 2022, however, when he accused her of making false claims about their child support case. “Just heard that my ex was claiming I spent years taking her to court and asking for child support,” he wrote under an Instagram post showing sliver of a court document. Pointing out his name on the “respondent” line, he then wondered, “How was I the Respondent then???”</p><h2>Noah Shannon Green</h2><p id=content-paragraph-17><strong>Noah Green</strong> is the first son Brian and Megan had together. The actress gave birth to him on September 27, 2012, making him 10.</p><p id=content-paragraph-18>Megan announced his birth <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>via Facebook</a>, calling her little guy “healthy, happy, and perfect.” “We are humbled to have the opportunity to call ourselves the parents of this beautiful soul,” she went on.</p><p id=content-paragraph-19>Over the years, Noah has independently developed his own sense of style, and has been photographed out with his parents while wearing dresses and skirts. Despite criticism of the way the child dresses, Brian and Megan have both stood up for their eldest boy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Brian-Austin-Green-kids-dwts-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-20>In 2017, Brian insisted, “My son, he’s four. I’ve heard from some people that they don’t agree with him wearing dresses. To them, I said, ‘I don’t care. He’s four and if he wants to wear it, then he wears it.’ It’s his life. They’re not my clothes. I feel like at four, at five, there’s a time when he should be having fun. He’s not harming anyone wearing a dress, so if he wants to wear a dress, good on him.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-21>Megan has also <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>been vocal</a> about how important it is for her to teach her kids’ confidence, regardless of what bullies at school are saying. In 2019, she recalled asking Noah about how other kids in school reacted to a dress he wore one day, and he replied, “All the boys laughed when I came in, but I don’t care. I love dresses too much.”</p><h2>Bodhi Ransom Green & Journey River Green</h2><p id=content-paragraph-22>Megan and Brian’s second son,&nbsp;<strong>Bodhi Ransom Green</strong>, was born on Feb. 12, 2014, making him eight. One year after Bodhi’s birth, Megan and Brian briefly broke up. However, by the time the public knew they were back together in 2016, there was already another baby on the way!</p><p id=content-paragraph-23>“This pregnancy was not planned, but when they found out they were extremely happy,” an insider told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>E! News</a> at the time. <strong>Journey River Green</strong> was born on August 4, 2016, making him six now.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Brian-Austin-Green-kids-dwts-embed3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-24>Like their older brother, Journey and Bodhi have both been the victims of online bullying due to the long length of their hair. When Brian posted a photo with all three boys in Sept. 2020, he was hit with comments claiming that his sons “looked like girls.” Naturally, the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>actor hit back.</a> “The fact is, my boys have and like long hair,” he wrote.</p><p id=content-paragraph-25>“In my opinion, they are beautiful and will still be and possibly be mistaken for girls if they wore matching short and t-shirt combos and had short hair. Some people like boys and men with long hair. Some people don’t. Both opinions are ok.” Don’t mess with papa bear!</p><h2>Zane Green</h2><p id=content-paragraph-26>Things got very serious between Brian and Sharna very quick. They sparked <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>relationship rumors</a> in Dec. 2020 after enjoying a romantic getaway to Hawaii together following their time as a team on Dancing With The Stars.</p><p id=content-paragraph-27>By Feb 2021, they announced they were <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>expecting a baby</a> together. Baby<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>&nbsp;<strong>Zane</strong></a> was born back in June 2022. Sharna announced his birth with a black and white Instagram photo of Brian holding his baby boy’s fingers. The caption said, “Zane Walker Green 06/28/2022 at 12:12pm. My heart is now forever outside of my body. Brian also shared the same post with two hearts.</p><p id=content-paragraph-30>The actor talked about what it was like to be a dad in his late 40s in Sep. 2020 with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Us Weekly</a>, he admitted, “It’s been a while. When he was born, there was that thought of like, ‘Man, it’s been like six years, do I still have this in me?’ And then right away, changing diapers and swaddling and burping and all the things are just sort of second nature at this point. I’ve done it so many times.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-31>While he has more experience with parenting, the Desperate Housewives alum gave first-time mom Sharna major credit for stepping up. “I always say that the easiest part is to become a mother or a father,” he told Us. “Almost anybody can have a baby, but to be a parent — that’s the work. Getting up in the morning, making breakfast, making lunch for school, bedtime rituals and bathtime … that’s when the real work comes in.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-32>“[Sharna’s] amazing with that. She’s been so hands-on with him. At this point in my life, to have a partner that is as hands-on, and in love with the process as she is — even when she’s exhausted… it’s so nice to have a partner that shares in that duty.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/brian-austin-green-and-sharna-mega-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-33>Brian also revealed that his older boys are just “obsessed” with their baby brother. He told Yahoo Life in Sep. 2022, “All of them are so obsessed with Zane and just so in love with him.</p><p id=content-paragraph-34>“There’s been no issue with that at all; there’s been no friction in the situation, he went on about&nbsp;the boys’ connection with their stepmom Sharna. “From day one, they’ve absolutely embraced Sharna and now embrace Zane,” he said. “It’s been amazing. It’s really been a blessing.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8GroJqmXZbCtMDIp2SgqpWau263yJ2qZmxlZoZ1fZBo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
