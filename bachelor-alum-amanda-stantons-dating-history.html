Though she didn’t walk away with the final rose, Stanton continued to search for love in front of the lens.</p><p>Following her stint on The Bachelor, Stanton headed to Mexico — twice — to film <a href=#>Bachelor in Paradise</a>. During her first season on BIP, the California native <a href=#>walked away with a proposal</a> from ex-fiancé <a href=#><strong>Josh Murray</strong></a>.</p><p>Despite her broken engagement to Murray, Stanton <a href=#>gave love another shot</a> and returned to the hit ABC series where she sparked a romance with former boyfriend, <strong><a href=#>Robby Hayes</a>.</strong>&nbsp;Yet again, Stanton was left heartbroken when things didn’t work out following their time on the show.</p><p>It was Stanton’s nearly year-long relationship with <strong>Bobby Jacobs</strong> that had her Instagram followers <a href=#><strong>rooting for the pair to get engaged</strong></a>. The Lani the Label founder often documented family outings with Jacobs and her two daughters, Kinsley and Charlie, whom she shares with ex-husband <strong>Nick Buonfiglio</strong>.</p><p>After speculation Stanton and Jacobs split in April 2019, the professional volleyball player <a href=#>confirmed the news in an Instagram comment</a>. (Their breakup came shortly after the pair <a href=#>moved into a beachfront Laguna Beach, California home together</a>.)</p><p>Days later, Stanton revealed in a series of Instagram Stories that <a href=#>she was “blindsided” by the breakup</a>. “First and foremost, I want to clear the air about my kids. My kids know, no matter what, they are always my number one priority. Always. I remind them that every single day. They never feel like I’m choosing a guy over them, and that’s the silliest assumption about me that I’ve ever heard,” she said.</p><p>“It just happened very suddenly,” Stanton revealed. “Before I get into it, Bobby didn’t do anything wrong, so don’t go hating on him for it. Yes, I was surprised, but it’s OK.”</p><p>Us Weekly confirmed in August 2020 that the Now Accepting Roses author <a href=#>moved on with attorney <strong>Oren Agman</strong></a>.The following February, however, <a href=#>she introduced beau <strong>Michael Fogel</strong></a> to social media during a Valentine’s Day vacation in Mexico.</p><p>At the time, a source exclusively revealed that the couple were “taking things slow and just enjoying their time together” after being friends for years. “<a href=#>He has met her daughters</a>, of course, since they’re with her half the time,” the insider added, noting that Stanton’s pals thought Fogel was “a good match for her.”</p><p>Fogel had previously dated fellow Bachelor Nation member <a href=#><strong>Corinne Olympios</strong></a>, who exclusively told Us <a href=#>she was “a little uncomfortable”</a> by Stanton’s romance with her ex.</p><p>“She knows I will always be there for her. If she needs me, at the end of the day, I’ll be there for her. She’s been there for me. She just chose to do something that I don’t really think is right in a friendship,” Olympios confessed in March 2021. “It has nothing to do with the guy — I mean goodbye to the guy. It was more [that it] really hurt my feelings that someone I considered one of my best friends and family would even just be OK with doing that when I wouldn’t look at any of my friends’ boyfriends twice.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>By the end of the year, Stanton and Fogel were engaged.
