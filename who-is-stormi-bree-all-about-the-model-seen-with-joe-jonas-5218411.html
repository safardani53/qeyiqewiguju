She was named Miss Tennessee Teen USA in 2008, and the following year she competed for the Miss Teen USA title and won.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Since winning the competition, Stormi has modeled in tons of different publications, and she also has shown off many different styles in her work.</p><h2>She Was on Season 10 of ‘American Idol’</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>In addition to modeling, Stormi has also showed off her musical talent on plenty of occasions.<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> She auditioned</a> for season 10 of&nbsp;American Idol&nbsp;by singing “Father Can You Hear Me?” She made it to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Hollywood Week,</a> but she was eliminated in the first round.</p><h2>She Was Signed to Chris Brown’s Record Label</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>After her time on&nbsp;Idol,&nbsp;Stormi was a part of the electronic music group U.G.L.Y. In <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>an introduction video</a>, Stormi revealed that many of the people that she met in the music world came from her time in the Miss Teen USA pageant. Unfortunately, the group didn’t seem to pan out in the long run. They released the single “<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>REDD</a>” in 2013, and the music video was directed by&nbsp;<strong>Chris Brown.&nbsp;</strong>The group was signed to the R&B singer’s label CBE, per R<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>ap-Up.&nbsp;</a></p><h2>She Has Dabbled in Acting</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>Besides her music and modeling careers, Stormi has also shown that she’s a talented actress. She has appeared in a one off episode of&nbsp;Brooklyn Nine-Nine.&nbsp;She also appeared in the 2021 movie&nbsp;Hot Water.&nbsp;She’s also appeared in a few short films and music videos for the alternative singer&nbsp;<strong>Saro,&nbsp;</strong>per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>IMDb</a>.</p><h2>She Has a Daughter</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>Stormi is also a mom to a daughter&nbsp;<strong>Gravity.&nbsp;</strong>She revealed that having a daughter shifted her perspective on beauty and modeling in a 2018 interview with<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>&nbsp;</a><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Rose Inc</a>. She also revealed her hopes to buy a home in Malibu to raise her&nbsp; daughter in. “The amount of effort that I put in before having Gravity was so different. Now I gravitate toward a more natural look. After her birth, I refused to put makeup on or to do my hair for at least two months. I just felt so fulfilled and fixated on her that I didn’t feel like impressing anyone. So I didn’t. I saw how beautiful and perfect she was. I think it that it made me feel more human,” she said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2LAtbvRpqBmmqKasm6ty6VkmpqfqsFuwMeeZKanlJq5br%2FEnqVmr5mptW62zp5ko6eelsBugZFqb21pYWQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
