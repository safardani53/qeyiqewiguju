Another joked, “She’s going viral viral just to save $20.”</p><p>Someone else added, “Her face immediately screamed she was guilty.”</p><p>Others noted that ordering food to one’s workplace and refusing to pay is downright ludicrous. “How could y’all have DoorDash deliver to your WORKPLACE and then have the audacity not to pay?
