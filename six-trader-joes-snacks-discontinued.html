Fans of Trader Joe's swear by the store's creative snacks and are constantly trying new products.
In order to make the new products, they have to get rid of some of the old ones. Last month alone 10 products were discontinued and pulled off the shelves.

GORGONZOLA CRACKERS</h2><p>These crispy crackers were regularly paired with Trader Joe's soups.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE ON TRADER JOES">READ MORE ON TRADER JOES</h2><p>They were discontinued in February, so some stores may have a few boxes on the shelves still.</p><h2>2. KETCHUP SPUD CRUNCHIES</h2><p>One of the more unique snacks available at Trader Joe's was the french fry-shaped potato chips that were, as you can probably guess, ketchup-flavored.</p><p>They were introduced in 2019 and ultimately discontinued due to a lack of mass appeal.</p><p>If you're seriously craving these, you could try the Lay's ketchup-flavored chips that are going for a whopping $13 a bag on <a href=# aria-label="Amazon (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Amazon</a>.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Money</h2></p><h2>3. HATCH CHILE CHICKEN WRAPS</h2><p>These wraps could be quickly popped in the oven or microwave for a quick snack.</p><p>They were filled with grilled white meat chicken and black beans which were seasoned with a variety of spices.</p><p>Unfortunately, they were discontinued the same year they were introduced, according to <a href=# aria-label="Restaurant Clicks (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Restaurant Clicks</a>.</p><h2>4. PUMPERNICKEL PRETZELS</h2><p>Trader Joe's has a plethora of pretzel snacks, but nothing will replace these.</p><p>Shoppers can still choose from <a aria-label="Pretzel Slims (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Pretzel Slims</a>, <a aria-label="Dark Chocolate Almond Butter Pretzel Nuggets (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Dark Chocolate Almond Butter Pretzel Nuggets</a> and <a href=# aria-label="Honey Wheat Pretzel Sticks (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Honey Wheat Pretzel Sticks</a>.</p><h2>5. SPECULOOS COOKIE BUTTER CHEESECAKE BITES</h2><p>Trader Joe's describes cookie butter as, "a deliciously addictive spread made with crushed Belgian Speculoos cookies, its flavor reminiscent gingerbread."</p><p>Now combine those flavors with creamy cheesecake and a crunchy crust.</p><p>These sold for just $4.49 before ultimately being discontinued.</p><h2>6. TOFU EDAMEME NUGGETS</h2><p>The discontinuation of this product takes away another option for vegetarian eaters.</p><p>When they stopped production back in 2016 fans were quick to voice their displeasure.</p><p>"Just found out Trader Joe's tofu edamame nuggets were discontinued this year, so now 2016 can REALLY suck it," a&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">customer tweeted</a>.</p><h2>GOOD NEWS ON THE HORIZON</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/www-traderjoes-com-home-products-799763135.jpg><p>Shoppers were fearful that <a href=#>Trader Joe's frozen hashbrowns</a> were next on the chopping block, but luckily they are here to stay.</p><p>Fans <a href=#>searched</a> for the&nbsp;<a href=#>McDonald’s</a>&nbsp;hashbrown dupe for months on end with no luck.</p><p>“Our hashbrown patties have not been discontinued,” a Trader Joe’s spokesperson confirmed to The U.S. Sun.</p><p>Once you realize just how popular they are, it's easy to see why they're hard to find.</p><p>Cashiers have reportedly told customers the hashbrown patties sell out in&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">two days,</a>&nbsp;with some shoppers grabbing 10 packages at a time.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>While the hashbrowns are safe, these <a href=#>six frozen foods</a> are gone from shelves.</p><p>Plus, see the <a href=#>dupe for a Trader Joe's</a> snack you can find at Costco.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57zKilnrFfbIJ1hJRyb2irma16tb7AnZyrZZqksrR50qeYnKOjYrGqv8Kopa2hnqqypXs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
