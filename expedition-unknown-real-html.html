While a significant number of viewers believe it is real, others believe it is fake or staged.&nbsp;&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Most of them take social media to discuss it, especially the r/ExpeditionUnknown&nbsp;subreddit. A <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Reddit user</a> wrote that they found the show cool but cheesy and fake.&nbsp;</p><p>They explained their experience of watching an episode that discussed Nazi Gold to prove their point. In the episode, the cast members visit underground tunnels.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>When they were about to see where the tunnels led, they got&nbsp;scared about the radiation and got out of there. The user felt no danger, but the people "were just trying to be dramatic." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p></p><p><strong>Fans discussing the question - is Expedition Unknown real?</strong> (Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Reddit</a>)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>They also pointed out that Gates "always seems to make these huge discoveries while filming the show." As a result, they believed the series seemed "scripted and staged."&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Another user <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">claimed</a> that the show is "so fake it's painful." They strongly believed that only documentaries were real and others were mostly staged.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>Similarly, some pointed out that&nbsp;Search for the Afterlife was fake with no evidence. They called Bob Larson a con-man and accused him of taking advantage of mentally ill people.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Others pointed out that these series were for entertainment only and were open to interpretation. Some people enjoy watching the show&nbsp;even if they think it's staged.&nbsp;</p><p>One user noted that the Discovery series&nbsp;was about "chase and journey" rather than "the gold and the glory." They believed the viewers enjoyed the experience through Gates.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p></p><p><strong>Fans discuss if the series is real or fake. </strong>(Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Reddit</a>)</p><p>They advised to "enjoy the show for what it is" and discover unknown parts of the world. They suggested exploring histories and cultures via it and escaping every once in a while.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>In the same manner, another Reddit user believed that the series&nbsp;was "obviously staged." However, they wished Gates and his team would dive deeper into the topics they cover.&nbsp;</p><p>They credited the show for introducing interesting subjects and helping them broaden their knowledge.</p><p>At the end of the day, until and unless the creators or Gates clarify themselves, we won't know for sure if the show is real or fake.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJ2opbKltdOipqdlpaO4r7vWp2SrnZGhe6nAzKU%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
