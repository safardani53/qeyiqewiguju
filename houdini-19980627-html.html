He first caught the attention of an American magazine, then of "Harry 'Handcuff' Houdini" during a trip to Europe, where he dared the police to lock him up. Soon after, he expanded his repertoire to include leashes, ropes fallen from skyscrapers, tight clothing, and had to escape and hold his breath in a milk jug sealed with water. In 1904, thousands of people watched him try to get rid of the special handcuffs ordered by the Daily Mirror in London, which delighted them for an hour. Another waterfall saw him buried alive and able only to crawl to the surface, emerging in an almost debilitating state. While many people suspected that these escapes were bogus, Houdini saw himself as the calamity of false psychics.</p><table class=wikibox readability=9.5><tr readability=6><td class=wk_label>Born</td><td class=wk_value>Erik Weisz, March 24, 1874, Budapest, Austria-Hungary (now Hungary)</td></tr><tr readability=6><td class=wk_label>Died</td><td class=wk_value>October 31, 1926, Detroit, Michigan, U.S.</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Cause of death</td><td class=wk_value>Peritonitis</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Nationality</td><td class=wk_value>American</td></tr><tr readability=5><td class=wk_label>Occupation</td><td class=wk_value>Illusionist, escapologist, stunt performer, mysteriarch</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Years active</td><td class=wk_value>1891–1926</td></tr><tr readability=2><td class=wk_label>Relatives</td><td class=wk_value>Theodore Hardeen (brother)</td></tr></table><p>Rapper Houdini was born in Canada on June 27, 1998.
