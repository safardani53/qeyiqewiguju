Events company AXS alerted fans on Tuesday that an upcoming appearance in London <a href=#>would no longer occur after issuing refunds.</a></p><p>“We regret to inform you that the Justin Bieber shows planned to take place at The O2 arena have been cancelled,” a statement from the company read, according to <a href=#>CNN</a>. “We understand you will be disappointed and apologise [SIC] for any inconvenience this may cause.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Justin-Bieber-Seemingly-Cancels-Remaining-Justice-World-Tour-Dates-Amid-Hailey-Biebers-Drama-With-Selena-Gomez-2.jpg><p>Bieber’s decision to seemingly hit pause on touring comes <a href=#>after he previously postponed his Justice World Tour</a>. In June 2022, the “Peaches” singer, 29, announced that he would be taking a break <a href=#>after being diagnosed with Ramsay Hunt syndrome.</a></p><p>“This is pretty serious as you can see,” he said in an Instagram video <a href=#>while showing his partial facial paralysis</a>. “I wish this wasn’t the case. But obviously, my body is telling me I need to slow down.”</p><p>The official social media account for his tour confirmed a pause in performances that same month, writing via Instagram, “In light of Justin’s ongoing recovery, the remaining US Justice Tour shows scheduled for June and early July will be postponed.”</p><p>At the time, a source exclusively told Us Weekly that Bieber <a href=#>was “working with a top team of specialists” and was “following their advice”</a> about addressing his health struggle. The performer’s recovery involved “facial exercises,” “getting as much rest and relaxation” as possible and his commitment to his faith.</p><p>“[He] has every faith this will resolve itself eventually, but of course, it’s a stressful situation to be dealing with and a tough time for both [him and Hailey] right now,” the insider added. “The last thing he wanted was to postpone the concerts.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Justin-Bieber-Seemingly-Cancels-Remaining-Justice-World-Tour-Dates-Amid-Hailey-Biebers-Drama-With-Selena-Gomez-3.jpg><p>The <a href=#>update in Bieber’s professional life</a> comes as his wife, <a href=#><strong>Hailey Bieber (née Baldwin)</strong></a>, is making headlines for an apparent feud with his ex <a href=#><strong>Selena Gomez</strong></a>.</p><p>Late last month, the model, 26, faced backlash for <a href=#>a video that resurfaced of her pretending to gag</a> while discussing <a href=#><strong>Taylor Swift</strong> </a>on Drop the Mic. In response, Gomez, 30, <a href=#>took to social media to defend her pal</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“So sorry, my best friend is and continues to be one of the best in the game,” the Wizards of Waverly Place alum wrote in the comments section. Gomez, <a href=#>who dated Bieber off and on from 2010 to 2018</a>, has since announced a social media break.</p><p>“I’m gonna be taking a second from social media because this is a little silly,” she explained in a TikTok livestream on February 23, <a href=#>days before returning to her platforms</a>. “I’m 30, I’m too old for this. But I love you guys so much, and I will see you guys sooner than later. I’m just gonna take a break from everything.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKGuq6Seu26uyJ6ZnqpdqLKmucinnqWxXZiur6%2FEpapmpJGowW7Azq6pZpyRqbK0ecCmoJ1lmJa2rbHYZpurmZ2WfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
