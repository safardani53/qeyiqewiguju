She’s one of my best friends and has been forever, and she was married to him twice.”</p><p>Evans, 39, made headlines on September 12 after he posted and quickly deleted a video on his Instagram Story of himself and a few friends playing the game Heads Up! The clip, which was a screen recording, then cut to his camera roll, which included a black-and-white close-up photo of his penis.</p><p>Two days later, the Hollywood hunk <a href=#>addressed the mishap for the first time</a>, tweeting, “Now that I have your attention …. VOTE Nov 3rd!!!”</p><p>Curtis responded to his tweet at the time, “My boy! Proud of him. Got MY attention!” <a href=#><strong>Hilarie Burton</strong></a> called Evans’ blunder a “power move,” while his Avengers costar <a href=#><strong>Mark Ruffalo</strong></a> tweeted, “Bro, while <a href=#>[<strong>Donald</strong>] <strong>Trump</strong></a> is in office there is NOTHING you could possibly do to embarrass yourself. See… solving lining.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Evans later admitted that he had “an <a href=#>interesting weekend full of lessons learned</a> [and] a lot of teachable moments,” saying on the Tamron Hall Show on September 15, “Things happen. It’s embarrassing, but you’ve gotta roll with the punches. I will say, I have fantastic fans who came to my support. That was really nice.”</p><p>The Captain America star was most recently linked to <a href=#><strong>Lily James</strong></a> and previously dated actresses including <a href=#><strong>Jenny Slate</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Jessica Biel</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Minka Kelly</strong></a>. A source exclusively told Us Weekly in January that he has tried to “be more <a href=#>private with his love life</a>” in recent years while “dating different women” and “having fun.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajmZ2esm64xJ5knK2iqba0edaopZ2doqh6qrKMnJ%2BroaNisretzaxkqaSRo7umsIynrJ2dXaW1sMDOZqOemZtk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
