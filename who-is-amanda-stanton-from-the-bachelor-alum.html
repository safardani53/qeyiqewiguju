In the fourth season of Bachelor in Paradise, Stanton did not give up hope and continued to look for love. She returned to the program and resumed her relationship with her ex-boyfriend Robby Hayes. But things did not work out with them, and she was upset again.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Amanda-Stanton-3.jpg alt="Amanda Stanton" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Stanton, the Lani, the Label creator, was previously involved with pro beach volleyball player Bobby Jacobs and later with Oren Agman, a New York City-based attorney.
