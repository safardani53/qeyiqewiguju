And while she worked steadily in film and television doing small parts here and there, nothing really hit until 1987. That was the year Kirstie landed her iconic role as Rebecca Howe on Cheers, replacing the eternally funny Shelley Long. For this, Kirstie would win her first Emmy.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>During the next six years, she went up against <a href=#>Ted Danson's</a> Sam Malone, using her deadpan delivery and dry humor. While on Cheers, Kirstie would star in a movie that people couldn't stop talking about. In 1989's Look Who's Talking, she played an unwed pregnant woman whose baby had the inner thoughts of a grown man (voiced by Bruce Willis). With <a href=#>John Travolta</a> by her side, the wildly successful movie spawned two slightly less popular sequels.</p><p>Her next run on television was as executive producer and star of Veronica's Closet, on which she played the titular Veronica. The show lasted three seasons from 1997 to 2000. After that, things started to get difficult when Kirstie struggled with her weight and the impossible beauty standards put on women by Hollywood. In 2010, she founded a weight-loss program called Organic Liaison but was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sued for false advertising</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Kirstie was quite outspoken about her political views. In 2016, she endorsed Donald Trump but later rescinded that after the "grab her by the p---y" incident surfaced. She would later praise Trump for his handling of the beginnings of the COVID-19 pandemic. She was also a member of the <a href=#>Church of Scientology</a> since 1979.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Celebrities took to social media to say their goobyes.</h2><p>Despite her complicated relationship with Hollywood, Kirstie still kept in touch with some former co-stars. Upon hearing she died, Look Who's Talking pal and fellow scientologist <a href=#>John Travolta</a> posted a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tribute to his Instagram</a>. "Kirstie was one of the most special relationships I’ve ever had," he wrote. "I love you, Kirstie.
