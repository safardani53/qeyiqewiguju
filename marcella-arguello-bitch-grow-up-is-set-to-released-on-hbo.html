The Warner Brothers website has provided a full summary of what to anticipate from the comedy special.

Marcella Arguello makes her solo debut with this delightfully relevant stand-up comedy show filmed at Brooklyn’s Roulette Intermedium.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Marcella-Arguello-Bitch-Grow-Up-1.jpg alt="Marcella Arguello Bitch, Grow Up" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The Warner Brothers website also highlights how this special will join the large line of Latino comedy specials currently available on HBO Max.&nbsp;These specials include Ian Lara’s Romantic Comedy (2022), Jesus Sepulveda’s Mr. Tough Life (2022), Frankie Quiones’ Superhomies (2021), Nick Guerra’s Love Me at My Worst (2020), Shayla Rivera’s It’s Not Rocket Science (2020), Jerry Garcia’s It’s Not My Weekend (2019), Gina Brillon’s Easily Offended (2019), Erik Rivera’s Super White (2019), and Orlando (2018).</p><h2>Who is Marcella Arguello?</h2><p>Marcella Arguello is a comedian from Los Angeles, California.
