Celebrities are always switching up their hairstyles both on and off the red carpet. Whether they’re dying their hair a new shade or rocking the hottest summer trend – beach waves – the stars are constantly surprising us. The latest hairstyle trend that a ton of stars seem to love is the updo and everyone from Bella Hadid, to Taylor Swift, has been rocking the look. Bella has been rocking updos everywhere lately, but she especially wore her hair up while she was at the 72nd Cannes Film Festival back in May. Bella chose to rock an updo on two separate occasions, and she first arrived at the Rocketman premiere on May 16 in sheer Dior Haute Couture white ball gown, throwing her brown hair into a sleek high bun, leaving one side of her hair slicked back and the other in a bouffant that was clipped back to the side, which was done by hairstylist, Danielle Priano. Just a day later, Bella arrived at the Pain and Glory premiere on May 17, in a cutout red Roberto Cavalli gown with a super slicked back middle-parted bun done by Amanda Lee, who gave Bella an extra curly updo bun, with her hair slicked back so tight, not one hair was out of place. Taylor Swift also tried the trend when she rocked a pretty little feminine updo when she was in Paris on May 25, as she threw her blonde hair up into a soft bun, keeping her bangs out in front of her face & leaving a few pieces of hair out on the sides, for an effortless look, which she paired with a floral yellow Self-Portrait dress. There were so many other stars who tried the updo hairstyle which you can see when you click through the gallery!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGinopujZLCmuMSbqaKsmZrAbsHPnaZmoJGev7TA2KWcrGWgnrC0ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
