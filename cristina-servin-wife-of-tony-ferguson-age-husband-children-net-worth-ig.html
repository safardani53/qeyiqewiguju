The names and whereabouts of her parents and her siblings are still a mystery.</p><p>Moving on to her education, Cristina went to Cal State Fullerton, and after that, she went to California State University. The young Cristina also participated in the Mexicano Universal Jalisco, a pageant in Jalisco, Mexico.</p><h2>Is Tony Ferguson still married?- Wife and Personal Life</h2><p>As we know by now, Tony is the husband of our beloved Cristina Servin. Her relationship is the main reason why most people know about her.</p><p>But it is also the reality that this very status overshadows most of her personality and life that she has inherited as Tony’s wife.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/cristina-004.jpg><p>Going back to their relationship, Cristina and Tony were together for a long time, even before they tied the knot. Though the duo has yet to reveal any details about it, their relationship mostly dates back to 2009.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Meet Samoa Joe’s wife Jessica Seanoa- Age, Child, Husband, Income, Instagram >></a></h4><p>Likewise, the two got engaged in 2011 and took the next step in the following year. Finally, in June 2012, the lovebirds exchanged their vows and started their life as husband and wife.</p><p>Of course, their wedding ceremony was done privately and only attended by their loved ones. After four years of being together, Cristina gave birth to their first child, a son on April 28, 2016. Upon his birth, the duo named him, <strong>Armand Anthony</strong>.</p><p>Since then, they have yet to give birth to another child. It looks as if the couple is content with their small family. Maybe that’s why they have been married for more than seven years now, still together and happy.</p><h3>Why did Cristina Servin file a restraining order against her husband?</h3><p>Now, marriage is a bond between two people built on trust, compromises, and lots of sacrifices. Despite being happy, there are many problems faced by the married couple.</p><p>Just ask one of them, and they will tell you how hard it is to maintain a healthy married life.</p><p>Having said that, Cristina and Tony seemed to have come across such a situation in their life right now. In 2019, the couple experienced some friction between them.</p><p>On March 13, 2019, Cristina filed a restraining order against her husband Ferguson, attracting a lot of media attention.

Tony also had insomnia and was having destructive habits like tearing the fireplace apart.</p><p>Not to mention, he believed a tracking chip was inserted into his leg during reconstructive knee surgery.</p><p>Similarly, following the order, on March 15, 2019, Cristina issued a statement clarifying her action. She also stated Tony did not physically abuse her or her son but was solely concerned about her husband.</p><h3>“Tony Ferguson is a good husband and a good father to our son. The current legal proceedings are part of a process to ensure that Tony will receive that help necessary to continue being the best possible husband and father, as well as to pursue his passion and career as a UFC champion fighter.”</h3><p>She also thanked all of their well-wishers.</p><h3>“All positive well wishes are sincerely appreciated and I hope our privacy will be respected.”</h3><p>On April 5, 2019, their hearing was postponed by Cristina’s legal team, and later the case was closed by April 23.&nbsp;</p><h2>Who is Tony Ferguson ‘El Cucuy’?</h2><p>After ranting about Cristina Servin’s husband, Tony, it would be only fair to know about him too.
