We would recommend looking for baby walkers at the following stores.</p><h2>How to choose the best baby walker</h2><p>There are lots of considerations when choosing a baby walker for your child.</p><p>Age ranges and restrictions vary so consider this to start with; some of the options in our list are suitable from six months while others state not to use until the child is 18 months.</p><p>Also, you may have a preference when it comes to materials. For example, wood is more eco-friendly than plastic.</p><p>There are practical considerations for parents too, such as whether the seat cover and any material features are machine-washable.</p><p>Finally, there are safety concerns when it comes to baby walkers so ensure you've fully researched this before choosing one for your child.</p><h2>How much do baby walkers cost?</h2><p>There's a wide range in pricing on baby walkers, starting from around £20 to £100 or more.</p><p>The brand often influences the price - as well as the number of functions the walker offers and if it is multi-purpose e.g. a bouncer as well as a walker.</p><p>Wooden walkers are also often more expensive but will often last longer too and are better for the environment than plastic walkers.</p><h2>Are baby walkers good for babies?</h2><p>There are some concerns about the safety of baby walkers that you should be aware of before your child uses one.</p><p>These concerns — mainly aimed at adjustable height, seated baby walkers rather than push walkers — stem from reports of injuries caused to babies while in seated walkers.</p><p>The European Standard for baby walkers was changed in 2005 to make them move more slowly to protect babies from trapping hands or limbs.</p><p>If you want to make sure you're buying the best baby walker, make sure it meets standard BS EN 1273:2005.</p><p>The <a href=#>NHS</a> advises that all baby walkers and bouncers encourage babies to stand on their tiptoes, which can delay walking if over-used so they recommend only using these for a maximum of 20 minutes at a time.</p><p>As with all baby gear, it is the parent's responsibility to make sure the items are being used safely and as intended, and you should be vigilant to never leave your child unattended.</p><h2><strong>What age can a baby go in a walker?</strong></h2><p>Baby walkers and activity centres are designed for a range of ages depending on how they can be used and the included features. Also, some can adapt and change how they're used as your baby grows.</p><p>Refer to each individual walker's details, which will state the age range for that specific product.</p><h2>How to use baby walkers</h2><p>Using a baby walker is pretty simple — parents simply place their child into the walker or encourage them to use the handles on push designs.</p><p>But to get infants to use them and get on the go, sometimes holding a favourite food or toy in front of them can be used as encouragement for them to start moving.</p><p>If this doesn't work, adults can gently pull the walker along whilst the baby is in it to show them.</p><h2>Which baby walker is best on carpet?</h2><p>The best baby walkers to use on carpet are those that your little one stands behind and pushes with their hands, such as the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">VTech First Steps</a> walker.</p><p>These aren’t suitable for babies who are only just sitting unaided, or those still a little unsteady on their feet.</p><p>Further to the changes made to the European Standard, designed to make baby walkers safe, the wheels on seated walker models have been deliberately designed to move more slowly and with greater resistance.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqysp2Wjmrmmr9OsZnBwZGaGdnyOm5ysrF2XrqPFjLCYpaOVp3w%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
