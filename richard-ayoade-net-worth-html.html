However, despite the&nbsp;acting chops that launched him towards having a dynamic career, Ayoade doesn't regard himself as a good actor. On the contrary,&nbsp;Richard considers his achievements to be unmerited, as per his conversation with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Guardian</a>.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Regardless of his claims, the comedian has done well for himself, landing varied projects while also amassing a decent net worth.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Richard Ayoade Thinks His Acting Range is&nbsp;Narrow.</h2><p>In The IT Crowd, Richard's character Moss is considered a socially awkward nerd with little to no interaction with anyone other than Roy and Jen (the sitcom's main casts).&nbsp;Moss's most recognizable and defining feature is perhaps his extremely soft voice, just like real-life Ayoade. Reportedly, the sitcom director told Richard to do his own natural voice for Moss&nbsp;as he was the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">geekiest person</a> in the world.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>And for this exact reason, The IT Crowd star says his acting range is ridiculously narrow.&nbsp;When talking to <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Radio Times</a>, Richard got into more detail about how he thought of his acting.</p><p>My range is so ridiculously narrow I don’t know if it counts. It’s just every couple of years someone I know has been stupid enough to put me in something.</p><p>Richard, the actor, can be quite hard on himself because, in the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview</a> with The Guardian, he even goes so far as to say that he wouldn't hire himself.&nbsp;</p><h2>Richard is a Multi-Talented Individual</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Contrary to how much Richard downplays his skills and accomplishments, he is a man of many talents. Besides being an actor, he is also a director and a writer. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>When talking about his directing, you have to start from the music video for Arctic Monkeys’ Fluorescent Adolescent. The 2007 music video was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">nominated</a> for the inaugural UK Music Video Awards, adding more weight to his directing. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Since then, he has directed multiple other <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">music videos</a> including Vampire Weekend’s Oxford Comma, Super Furry Animals’ Run Away, Kasabian’s Vlad The Impaler, and Yeah Yeah Yeahs’ Heads Will Roll.</p><p>Richard has also directed two movies so far, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Submarine</a> (2010) and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Double</a> (2013) starring Jesse Eisenberg. He also wrote the two movies along with several other works like Gareth Marenghi’s Darkplace (2004) and The Mighty Boosh (2007). <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2><span>How much is Richard Ayoade's Net Worth?</span></h2><p>Although Richard doesn't&nbsp;like to talk about his acting prowess or the lack thereof, The IT Crowd star has been a part of more than 35 TV series, shorts, and movies as an actor, which has not only repeatedly kept him in the limelight but has also shot up his net worth.&nbsp;Apart from his more under-the-radar involvement with films like Submarine, he has also starred in blockbuster franchises and movies such as The&nbsp;Mandalorian from the Star Wars Universe, Lego movies, and&nbsp;the&nbsp;famous British feature Paddington. Most recently, he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">voiced</a> Counsellor Jerry in Disney and Pixar's upcoming animated movie Soul. He has also written and directed dozens of productions.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>All of these projects have earned Ayoade both fame and also a financial success. According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Richard is worth $2 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6e2pLTAq5tmmamkrqWxjKecrWWnpL%2B1tI2hq6ak</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
