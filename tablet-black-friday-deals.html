and if we're being honest, we don't know if they're necessary for anyone who just wants a tablet for internet browing, streaming or keeping the kids entertained.</p><p>If you're on a tighter budget, we'd point you towards Amazon's fabulous line of Fire tablets, which are way more affordable.</p><p>The top-of-the-line Fire HD 10 Plus, for example, is exceptionally cheaper - especially as it's currently on sale for <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">£129.99</a>.</p><p>This is the sort of device that will satisfy most people if their needs most extend to Netflix binging and social-media scrolling.</p><p>Devices like the Fire HD 8 Kids tablet - which come with content locking and limited screen time - are, of course, perfect for children.</p><p>This device is <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">also on sale for £84.99</a>, and there are cheaper alternatives available - we don't have to tell you they will be very, very popular as Christmas pressies.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">More Amazing Black Friday Deals</h3></p><h2>Should I wait until Black Friday to buy a tablet?</h2><p>If you're after a high-end option from the likes of Samsung and Apple, we would say yes: hold off until late November comes around.</p><p>That's when we'll likely see the biggest price drops (although with Apple products, these probably won't be that substantial).</p><p>Amazon's current device sale is certainly offering some impressive savings - but it's not impossible they'll be bettered by the time Black Friday comes around.</p><p>Ultimately, deal-hunting at this time of the year is a bit of a gamble. If you like the prices being offered and you want to tick off a few items on your Christmas shopping list, we suggest you strike now.</p><h2>When is Black Friday 2021?</h2><p>This year, Black Friday is happening on November 26.</p><p>That's the day immediately after U.S. Thanksgiving, just like every year - <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Friday</a> being an American export.</p><p>While it's been going strong in the States since the Sixties, it's only grown in popularity in the last decade or so in the UK.</p><p>Now, though, it's a permanent fixture in the calendar, and it's when you'll find the very best discounts - so best get the 26th in your diary!</p><h2>Who will have the best tablet deals this Black Friday?</h2><p>You'll find the strongest discounts on tablets and devices from a relatively small number of retailers.</p><p>We've listed them below:</p><li>Amazon - <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">shop for tablets here</a></li><li>AO - <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">shop for tablets here</a></li><li>Argos - <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">shop for tablets here</a></li><li>Currys - <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">shop for tablets here</a></li><li>John Lewis - <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">shop for tablets here</a></li><li>Very - <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">shop for tablets here</a></li><p>But you should also head to brand websites during Black Friday, to see if the manufacturers themselves are offering any stand-out tablet deals.</p><li>Apple - <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">shop for tablets here</a></li><li>Samsung - <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">shop for tablets here</a></li><li>Huawei - <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">shop for tablets here</a></li><li>Lenovo - <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">shop for tablets here</a></li><h2>What tablet deals were there in Black Friday last year?</h2><p>Last we saw an impressive run of price drops across tablets from all the leading manufacturers, and from a number of major retailers.</p><p>At Amazon, the <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">2020 12.9-inch Apple iPad Pro</a> was reduced from £1,069 to £990.20 (it's currently £916.98).</p><p>Down at the other end of the price spectrum, the <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Kindle Kids</a> was reduced by Amazon from £99.99 to £59.99 (it's £74.99 right now).</p><p>John Lewis, meanwhile, knocked £50 off the <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite</a>, bringing it down from £349 to £299 (currently £329).</p><p>The higher-spec <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 Plus</a> was slashed by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Very</a> from £799 to £719.</p><h2>When is Cyber Monday 2021?</h2><p>Cyber Monday always happens after the weekend that immediately follows <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Friday</a>.</p><p>So this year, it's happening on Monday November 29.</p><p>It's got the (slightly old-fashioned-sounding) name as historically, Cyber Monday was a day of online-only sales - most shoppers having exhausted themselves dashing around the stores on Black Friday itself.</p><p>These days, however, there's very little difference between the two sales days, as you'll rarely find any deals that are only available in-store.</p><p>Cyber Monday is generally when retailers send out their final wave of special offers, and reduce prices even further on their remaining stock.</p><p>So if you see a fantastic tablet deal on Black Friday, there's always a chance it could be further reduced when Cyber Monday comes around - but there's an equal chance it sells out before then.</p><p>Our advice?
