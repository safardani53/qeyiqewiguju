Their witty one-liners and over-the-top fashion choices only added to the charm that the <a href=#>high school besties</a> had onscreen.</p><p>The film follows longtime friends Romy (Sorvino) and Michele (Kudrow) as they prepare to reinvent themselves ahead of <a href=#>their 10-year high school reunion</a>. After being outcasts during their teenage years, the twosome are determined to surprise all their classmates with their successful journey post-graduation.</p><p>The issue, however, is that they are both single and don’t have high-powered jobs. In an attempt to save face once they arrive at the reunion, they lie about what they do for a living, claiming they invented Post-Its. Throughout the night, Romy and Michele confront old bullies, connect with high school crushes, and realize they will always have each other.</p><p>Ten years after the movie gained a cult following, Sorvino teased the possibility of doing another film with Kudrow.</p><p>“I want a Romy and Michele’s High School Reunion sequel — hands down. The fans have been clamoring for it,” the Mimic actress exclusively told <a href=#>Us Weekly in July 2018</a>. “We would love to do it.”</p><p>One year later, Sorvino <a href=#>doubled down on her comments</a>, telling Us in June 2019, “[We] are all down for it. It’s just [up to] the powers that be.”</p><p>The Mighty Aphrodite actress revealed that she and the Friends alum are “still good friends” and aren’t opposed to reuniting on screen. The same goes for <a href=#><strong>Elaine Hendrix</strong></a>, who portrayed high school mean girl Lisa, who later became an ally of Romy and Michele at the Arizona event.</p><p>“To my knowledge, pretty much everyone has said yeah, including Mira and Lisa. We’re like, ‘Yeah, we would do another one.’ So, I don’t know,” the <a href=#>Parent Trap</a> actress <a href=#>exclusively told Us</a> in July 2021. “I don’t know how real it ever got, because it’s not like the studio was checking in on us. It’s just fans.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Kudrow and Sorvino treated fans to an in-person reunion at <a href=#>the 2022 SAG Awards in February</a> when they presented the award for Outstanding Performance By a Cast (or Ensemble). The pair paid tribute to their characters’ iconic pink and blue ensembles — which the duo wore while<a href=#> dancing to “Time After Time”</a> at the reunion — and they even brought Post-Its along for their bit.</p><p>Scroll down to see what the cast of Romy and Michele have been doing since the late ‘90s:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BnvK7FjJqlnWWdnrCpscueqmagmZy1br%2FCoaaopF2nsra6yKilZpuRqMFuw8eeqZ5lkaeybsDHnrBmpp%2BsfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
