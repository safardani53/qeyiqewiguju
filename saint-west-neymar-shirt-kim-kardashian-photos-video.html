Saint, 7, and his mom, <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Kim Kardashian</a></strong>, were in Japan to see <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Neymar</a>, Kylian Mbappé </strong>and the rest of PSG square off against <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Cristiano Ronaldo</a></strong>, <strong>Seko Fofana</strong>, and the rest of the Al-Nassr squad. “So thankful that our boys’ dreams are coming true,” Kim, 42, captioned a July 31 Instagram Gallery that showed the highlights from this trip – including when Neymar, 31, tossed a t-shirt to Saint. Saint gleefully danced in triumph after he snatched it from the air and showed it to his mom.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>This isn’t the first that fans have seen Saint at this game. Kim initially posted the photos to her IG story after the game, and YouTuber <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>IShowSpeed</strong></a> (aka Darren Watkins Jr.) also spotted Kim, Saint, and their crew in the stands. “Why you got that PSG [jersey] on?” Darren asked Saint, to which the young boy said, “Because I’m gonna meet Neymar first.” Saint also got to meet Ronaldo, 38, after the game – and he switched to an Al-Nassr kit before he did. Saint posed with the football legend for a photo, and Ronaldo even taught Saint a handshake that included his trademark goal celebration.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>On July 28, Kim <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>shared some photos</a> from her and Saint’s trip to Miami to see Messi, 36, play his first game with Inter Miami. Along with pictures of her and Saint next to <strong>David </strong>and <strong>Victoria Beckham</strong>, Kim posted some pictures of Saint hanging out with the World Cup champ. “Legendary,” Kim said of the whole experience.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/kim-kardashian-saint-west-soccer-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Kim has been <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a good soccer mom</a> for Saint. The two <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>attended the Arsenal vs. Sporting Lisbon game</a> on Mar. 16. The @AFCStuff twitter account reposted Kim’s Instagram story, showing how Saint donned “a <strong>Katie McCabe </strong>jersey, cheering for <strong>Bukayo Saka</strong> as he takes his penalty during the shootout against Sporting CP tonight.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>While overseas for the Arsenal/Sporting match, Saint and Kim also made time to catch a PSG game, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE</a>. Shortly after that, Kim posted a photo of her son meeting Kylian Mbappé, 24, to her Instagram story. Kim also shared a clip of her son and his friend FaceTiming with Neymar. “The luckiest boys in the world,” she captioned the shot, “Facetiming [Neymar] to wish him a speedy recovery.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH14e5JqZqyZmaPBbsPErKtmppWuuqK%2BjKyfoqqkYriquYykmKuckai1qq3NZqehp6SkwG7CyJ2cqGc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
