He was truly loved, and we know how many of you loved him too," Vanderpump wrote alongside a series of adorable photos of the pooch.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Bravo star shared that Giggy played a pivotal role in why she and Todd wanted to start their <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Vanderpump Dog Foundation</a> in 2016.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Our sweet Gigolo was such an incredible, unique dog, but mainly, because of him, we started The Vanderpump Dog Foundation and embarked on our mission to save as many dogs as possible," she continued. "He inspired us to start our work in rescue, and for that we will always be grateful."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Giggy's legacy will live on, through every dog @vanderpumpdogs saves. Thank you all for your support. Rest In Peace Giggy, we love you," she concluded the post.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Giggy.</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Speaking to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>BravoTV.com</a> in March 2019 about her sweet dog, Vanderpump said Giggy — who also had alopecia — was about 9½ years old at the time and had gone through a "real hiccup" the previous year.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Giggy actually had a real hiccup last February — and February through about August, where he was being monitored very closely. He spent a lot of [time] in the hospital, which was very difficult for us because he hated being left behind," she shared. "But he was kind of in an incubator. He was on a heart monitor. We actually have a pacemaker waiting for him — a tiny, tiny little pacemaker, if he does need it."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Vanderpump added, "He's still a young little Gigolo, but we've just got to be careful with his little heart. We worship him. I mean, Ken's even more obsessed than I am."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On Saturday, <a href=# data-inlink=true data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Andy Cohen</a> also mourned Giggy's death with several tributes on Instagram Story. "Giggy was the first dog of Bravo," he wrote along with a throwback photo of Vanderpump and Giggy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"My parents loved him too! Everybody loved him!" Cohen wrote in a separate post.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Vanderpump's daughter, Pandora, told PEOPLE in January 2018 that Giggy had become ill while the family was on vacation in Aspen, Colorado.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Giggy, as many dogs are, was affected by the altitude," she said. "Unbeknownst to us, he had a slight chest infection which exacerbated his symptoms."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Pandora added, "After this experience, we have a better understanding of how altitude can affect dogs health and want to make people more aware of this."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Giggy was flown back home to Beverly Hills in an oxygen tank, with a photo shared by Vanderpump.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2017, Vanderpump <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>lost two other members of her four-legged family:</a> Pomeranians Pikachu and Pink Dog.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She honored both with Instagram tributes, writing about Pikachu, "Rest in peace my sweet Pikachu, we will miss you so much… Such sadness at your loss," adding a crying emoji.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6CawbR7y6KqmmWmlrulsdGprKaoXZm8qHnGop6gsV2Ztqa%2Fjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
