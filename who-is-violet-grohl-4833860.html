It wasn’t until 12 years later that Violet let the world have a peek at her natural singing talents.</p><h2>Her first public performance was an Adele cover.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>Back in 2018, Violet collaborated with her father on a cover of <strong>Adele’s&nbsp;</strong>“When We Were Young” for a UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospitals benefit concert, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Entertainment Weekly</a>. The British, Grammy-winning singer is quite a tough act to emulate, but pre-teen Violet wowed the audiences with her incredible range and control.</p><h2>Violet rocked out on stage at Lollapalooza.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>As recently as August, Violet took over lead vocals during part of the Foo Fighters set at&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Lollapalooza</a>, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Entertainment Weekly</a>.

Backed by a full band — with her dad on drums — Violet joined the party with her mind-blowing version of the ditty from Amy’s first album.</p><h2>Violet paid respect with song at the Taylor Hawkins Tribute concert.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>More recently, Violet lent her dulcet tones to the<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> tribute concert</a> for Dave’s late bandmate<strong> Taylor Hawkins</strong>. After introducing the band made up of himself, <strong>Alain Johannes, Jason Falkner </strong>and <strong>Chris Chaney</strong>, Dave welcomed Violet to the mic, deeming her “the only person I know who can actually sing a Jeff Buckley song,” according to the outlet. Violet then wowed the crowd with her renditions of Jeff’s songs “Last Goodbye” and “Grace”.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2LDqrvLnqtmn6Kkta15k3FqbHBmZXw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
