The Bridesmaids star popped up in a hilarious 1940s-themed sketch with a distinctly ’90s sound (yes, you read that right) that included a hilarious cameo by musical performer <strong>Dua Lipa</strong>, 25. “Well it’s Christmas Eve and you might be missing something special. So I’ve got a song for you — but I need a volunteer!” Kristen’s red-lipped solder announced as Bowen Yang’s character appeared up for the dig.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dua-lipa-snl-nbc-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>“Stay on the rhythm!” she declared, as the song — clearly inspired by the late <strong>Whitney Houston</strong>‘s 1999 classic “It’s Not Right But It’s OK” — began. Of course, the duo started with a phone conversation as an “interlude,” just like any R&B tune from the decade. “Boy I won’t be coming home…I got work. Don’t wait up,” Kristen hilariously said, as Bowen got&nbsp;right&nbsp;into the singing. “Is that right? Because you know that I’ve been hanging out all night,” he said. “You can help the way you treat me.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>“Doing me wrong and doing me right/Where do you go in the middle of the night,” they then sang together on the chorus, which was a dead ringer for the original <strong>Darkchild</strong> produced song. “Doing me wrong and doing me right/You’re pissing me off/It’s a long fight,” they continued as Kristen hilariously straddled Bowen. Their audience of 1940’s soldiers seemed particularly confused, noting they weren’t sure if the performance as a “play” while another said it was “noisy.”</p><p lang=und dir=ltr><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/6lvgKGLdcw</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>— Saturday Night Live – SNL (@nbcsnl) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>December 20, 2020</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>“My girl Shaniece saw you at the club!” Bowen then accused Kristen, who retorted,&nbsp;“Well she needs to get her eyes checked.” He then questioned,&nbsp;“So why does the car smell like sex with a girl who isn’t me? Break it down ya’ll” (Kristen appeared to be singing from a male perspective, while Bowen sang from a female’s).&nbsp;“Girl do you wear red Satin panties?” Kristen asked as Dua Lipa charged out on stage.&nbsp;“I’ve been looking for those!” she hilariously said, joining the comedic duo for the final chorus.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>The Canandaigua, New York native was announced to be hosting the Dec. 19 episode alongside musical guest <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Dua Lipa</strong></a>, 25, a month prior. “Wiig Returns” a tweet on the official&nbsp;SNL&nbsp;twitter read on Dec. 16, including an epic montage of some of her most memorable <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Christmas sketches</a> (including one of the “Target Lady” ones).

The good thing about being at SNL, for me creatively, is to think, ‘Okay, I’m comfortable enough. I really want to try something that’s not something that I normally do.'”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpgZH5ze5FpZp2tkWK5qrzAZqKroaOpsq951qKgoGWjo7luw8eiq6edqWK1sMHSraanZaOku6h50qScrZuYYsOqsMSoZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
