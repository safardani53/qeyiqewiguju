Guy’s Ultimate Game Night combines discussion, cooking, and game shows.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Tara-Lipinski-2.jpg alt="Tara Lipinski" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>According to the show’s official synopsis:</p><p>“The new game show puts a culinary spin on traditional party games, with celebrity participants competing in front of a live studio audience to win prizes for their favorite charity.” Chef Antonia Lofaso oversees the whole competition, as the celebrities interact with food in the hands-on challenge and put their culinary skills to the test with quizzes and word puzzles.
