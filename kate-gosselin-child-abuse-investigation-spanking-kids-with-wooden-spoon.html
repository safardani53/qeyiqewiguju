However, one of her eight kids, <strong>Collin Gosselin</strong>, 12, is not expected to appear on the new season since Kate recently relieved to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People mag</a> that <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>she sent him away due to his “special needs</a>.” But while away, Collin has reportedly claimed that his mother abused him when he lived at home, sparking a child abuse investigation against the reality-star mom.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-2>“Collin said something to the facility’s staff and it was reported to Children and Youth Services [CYS], which started an official prob,” an insider revealed to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Life & Style</a> magazine. “The police later notified Colin’s dad, <strong>Jon [Gosselin</strong>, 39], that a child abuse investigation was opened.” Even crazier, if the allegations are deemed true, Kate would face up to seven years in prison!</p><h3><a href=#>Kate Gosselin: See Some Of Her Wildest TV Meltdowns&nbsp;</a></h3><p id=content-paragraph-3>Kate and Jon had an extremely ugly divorce back in 2009, and since then, Kate has had custody of their 12-year-old sextuplets: <strong>Collin</strong>, <strong>Aaden</strong>, <strong>Alexis</strong>, <strong>Hannah</strong>, <strong>Leah</strong>, and <strong>Joel</strong>, along with their 16-year-old twins <strong>Mady</strong> and <strong>Cara</strong>. Jon only has limited visitation rights and doesn’t even know where Collin is being held.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>“He worries every single day for his son,” the publication’s source said. And apparently, he has good reason to be afraid! “Jon used to have to grab Kate by her wrist to stop her from beating Collin and some of the other kids with a wooden spoon,” the insider continued. “He often had to stand between Kate and the kids to stop her from hitting them.” If true, this is so terrifying!</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Even journal entries allegedly written by Kate and published by author <strong>Robert Hoffman</strong> in Kate Gosselin: How She Fooled the World, help prove that Kate ran a strict, sometimes scary household — and even resulted to violence in order to control her kids. “I grabbed [Collin] and spanked him as hard as I could,” Kate revealed in a 2007 passage.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“I thought I may seriously injure him.” And according to Jon, the kids do not want to live with Kate anymore. “Every time I see them, the sextuplets tell me they want to live with me. They don’t want to go home,” Jon told Life & Style in 2014. We hope this situation gets resolved quickly for the sake of the children!</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Tell us, <strong>HollywoodLifers</strong> — do you think Kate has really spanked her children with a wooden spoon?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlmZH5ye49tZqSZpJp6qLvSrJyloZ5isKm1y51kmpqlqLJutc2vnKysmZyutbXOp2SsqJGjuKq6xmaiopyjYsSqwMdmrqinlJq7br%2FPqKanZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
