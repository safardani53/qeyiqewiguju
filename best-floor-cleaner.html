Before you start, always check the product you're using is designed for the floor you want to clean.
Wood, for example, needs special care to help preserve and protect it and harsh chemicals can strip the colour from laminate."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It takes 3.5 hours for a full charge, and then you can use it for 30 minutes.</p><p>We found this is more than enough to cover a small flat with multiple rooms but it obviously depends on the size of your home and how many times you go over the same area — the manufacturer recommends covering the same area three or four times.</p><p>You also have to vacuum your floor before using the Clean & Dry as it’s not designed to pick up big bits of debris so we think this device would be best suited for a once-a-month deep clean, or more often if you have kids or pets.</p><p>The Clean & Dry comes with two water tanks. The top one is for clean water or cleaning solution, depending on what you’re using. The bottom one is designed to store the water it sucks up, so you’re never cleaning your floor with dirty water.</p><p>To use the device, you simply run it back and forth across your floor as you would a normal vacuum cleaner, while also pressing the trigger on the handle to release the water/cleaning fluid onto the mop.</p><p>We found the Clean & Dry glided really across our hardwood floors even more easily than our usual vacuum cleaner. It also works for sealed laminate flooring and sealed tile flooring, which meant we could use it in the bathroom as well.</p><p>After use, the floor was pretty much dry (although it will still be damp to the touch) and there’s no streaking.</p><p>However, while the manufacturer recommends holding the trigger constantly while vacuuming, so water or cleaning solution is constantly released, we found this meant that there was too much liquid on the floor.</p><p>It was much easier to do a couple of wet passes and then do a couple of dry passes.</p><p>Overall, though, we found the Clean & Dry to be really easy to use and we really loved the results — especially now that we don’t need to stoop to get rid of any stains or spills.</p><h2>We tested: Bona spray mop kit for wood floors</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/3389089_R_Z001A.jpg><ul><li><strong>Bona spray mop kit for wood floors, £33 from Argos - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>Bona’s spray mop is an easy to assemble, affordable and easy to use floor cleaning kit.</p><p>The version we tested was for wood floors, so it came with a specially formulated cleaning solution, but you can also get kits for other types of flooring.</p><p>The mop itself comes in a fairly compact box, split into a few pieces, and all you have to do is click each one into place.</p><p>The cleaning solution then slots into the dedicated holder and you’re ready to go.</p><p>The idea is that instead of stooping to spray cleaning solution on your floor, you can spray as you go by pulling the trigger on the handle.</p><p>When we tested the spray mop, it was fairly easy to assemble but getting the cleaning solution in was a bit tricky. You have to listen out for a dull click as otherwise you get a stream of cleaning liquid rather than a spray when you pull the trigger.</p><p>Once we got it going, though, it was really easy to use. The spray released a fine mist that the microfibre cleaning head wiped away with ease, leaving lovely clean floors.</p><p>Afterwards, you just remove the cleaning head and rinse it under the tap. Then you can either wash it by hand, or pop it into the washing machine.</p><p>Although the Bona spray mop is really efficient, having just one mop head means it’s not great for dealing with larger areas, or if your floor is particularly dirty - the grime just accumulates on the surface of the material.</p><p>It means you either have to rinse it as you go or mop more regularly if you want seriously clean floors (rather than wiping the same space with a dirty mop head).</p><p>For lighter cleaning tasks, or if you have a couple of mop heads that you can swap out, we think this is a great option for those with kids or pets who might need to clean daily or weekly.</p><h2>Best handheld floor cleaner: Black and Decker handheld vacuum cleaner</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/7066676_R_Z001A.jpg><ul><li class="h2 product-name-main"><strong>Black & Decker Dustbuster handheld vacuum cleaner, £33 from Argos - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>Anyone with a pet, young children or a tendency to knock things over absolutely needs a Black & Decker Dustbuster in their lives.</p><p>It saves you having to sweep up food, pet hair and dirt at the end of the day - it also means you don't have to get the massive vacuum cleaner out.</p><p>It's perfect for doing that superficial floor clean without much effort.</p><h2>Best all purpose floor cleaner: Flash all purpose cleaner</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-24-at-07.51.37.png><ul><li><strong>Flash all purpose cleaner, 5l, £13.48 from Amazon - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>For professional-grade cleaning in a domestic setting, this fresh, lemon-scented cleaner from Flash can be diluted to clean floors or used on its own for a more intense clean.</p><p>This 5l bottle will last ages, and is great value for money, too.</p><p>Plus, it works on other surfaces like cupboards and baths to really get that deep-clean - and shine - all around the home.</p><h2>Best disinfecting floor cleaner: Zoflora</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/zoflora.jpg><ul><li class="a-expander-content reviewText review-text-content a-expander-partial-collapse-content" data-hook=review-collapsed><strong>Zoflora mixed pack cleaners, 12 x 120ml bottles, £17.76 from Amazon - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>We don't need to tell you there's bacteria living on the floor - we just need to point you in the direction of a strong disinfecting agent that will kill 99.9% of it.</p><p>This bundle gives you a pack of 12 cleaning solutions in an assortment of scents, including lavender, fresh linen, country garden, and cinnamon.</p><p>All you need to do is dilute four capfuls in a 1.5l bucket of water and then use it to mop hard tile and lino flooring.
