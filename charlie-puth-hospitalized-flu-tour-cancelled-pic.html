My doctor has instructed me not to perform for at least 48 hours. I will make it up to you guys I promise! The support on this tour has been incredible and I hate letting you down.”</p><h3><a href=#>See More Pics Of Charlie&nbsp;HERE</a></h3><p id=content-paragraph-4>Obviously, fans in Raleigh are devastated and anxiously waiting news about when the show will be rescheduled to, but of course, the number one concern is Charlie’s health! Meanwhile, after the Raleigh show, the 24-year-old is set to perform in New York City on Oct. 9, so hopefully <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>he’s feeling much better</a> by then and can get back on stage.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Charlie performed in Charlotte, NC on Oct. 6, and admitted on Twitter after that it was a rough one to get through. “I wouldn’t have gotten through that show being as sick as I am without your amazing energy,” he wrote. “All love.” Good thing he didn’t have to go through that again!</p><p id=content-paragraph-6><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, leave your well wishes for Charlie in the comments section below.
