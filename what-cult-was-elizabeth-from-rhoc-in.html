I was always scared for my life because we were beaten so bad that I thought for sure I was going to die one day of it," she added.&nbsp;</p><p>Earlier on in the episode, she also shared a few snippets of information about the role her relatives played in the day-to-day running of the Faith Bible Tabernacle.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>"My grandmother was the leader of the church and my father was the preacher and my family really wanted me to be a preacher," Elizabeth revealed in a confessional.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>However, she realized that it was best to approach their directives with a pinch of salt, and that sometimes, feigning interest was the best strategy.&nbsp;</p><p>"When I was eight years old, my grandmother asked me to speak in tongues in front of the church, and she says, 'The Lord needs to speak through Elizabeth.' And I just faked it, and they all bought it — in fact, even a member passed out,"<strong> </strong>Elizabeth<strong> </strong>revealed.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">"I grew up garbage-can poor," Elizabeth remarked on the Season 15 premiere of 'RHOC.'</h2><p>Although Elizabeth is regarded as one of the most affluent cast members currently appearing on the show — as the ex-wife of Norwegian businessperson Bernt O. Bodal, she receives $31,000 in monthly spousal support — she wasn't born into a life of luxury.&nbsp;</p><p>Previously, she described her childhood as disagreeable, hinting that she was raised in an unhealthy environment.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>It's understood that Elizabeth developed an understanding of the complications arising from financial deficiencies at an early age — and she claims that the lifestyle she and her family led was far from opulent.&nbsp;</p><p>"I grew up garbage-can poor. We were country hillbillies," Elizabeth remarked in a crucial scene of the Season 15 premiere, titled An Unexpected Secret.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Elizabeth says her grandmother was the leader of Faith Bible Tabernacle.</h2><p>The name of Elizabeth's grandmother has not yet been shared.
