Tottenham.</p><p>Man Utd, meanwhile, found an unlikely hero in McTominay.</p><span class=advert-wrapper__text>Advertisement</span><p>The <a href=#>Scotland</a> star scored an amazing late double against Brentford and will surely be rewarded with a start this time around.</p><p>McTominay will also be buoyed by Scotland's qualification for Euro 2024 and should be oozing with confidence.</p><img
