Pepsi Co., the iconic company behind the namesake cola and all those other yummy beverages like Sierra Mist, Gatorade, and Brisk, has had a few massive product fails since opening its doors in 1965. One of its biggest flops was its clear cola, which was named Crystal Pepsi.</p><p>Created in 1992, Crystal Pepsi was marketed as a healthier and lightweight cola option due to its transparency and lack of color. Unfortunately, it wasn't very popular and was retired from store shelves in 1994.</p><p>Over the years, Pepsi has temporarily brought back this fizzy clear soda in limited quantities to drum up nostalgia amongst its customers. Now, to celebrate the failed flavor's 30th anniversary, Pepsi is giving away FREE Crystal Pepsi.</p><p>Keep scrolling to learn how you can get your hands on a six-pack of Crystal Pepsi!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Pepsi is giving away FREE Crystal Pepsi away on Twitter.

Therefore, I will not be weighing in on this.</p><p>However, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Snack History</a>, the retired beverage tastes like a lighter and less sweet version of regular Pepsi.
