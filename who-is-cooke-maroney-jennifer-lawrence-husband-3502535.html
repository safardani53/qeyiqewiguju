So who exactly is Cooke Maroney? Well, unlike his wife’s high-profile IMDb page, Cooke is much more low-key…to most of the public. He’s not a director like JLaw’s most ex (Mother!&nbsp;director <strong>Darren Aronofsky</strong>), or an actor/musician like the other exes (The Favourite&nbsp;star <strong>Nicholas Hoult</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Coldplay</strong> frontman <strong>Chris Martin</strong>). Still, Cooke, who Jennifer <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>married in Oct. 2019</a>, has his own impressive street credibility. And they’re currently <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>house hunting in Beverly Hills</a>, so they’ve got exciting things to look forward to.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/jennifer-lawrence-in-green-sweatsuit-and-with-cooke-mega-embed.jpg><h2><strong>1. JLaw’s husband is a respected art gallerist.</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-3>Cooke is the director of Gladstone 64, an art gallery located in New York City’s ritzy Upper East Side. Before his current position, he was a transplant from NYC’s Gagosian gallery, another esteemed name in the art community. “He’s definitely respected. He’s not a big player, but he’s a player,” a contact from the art world told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Cut</a>. “I’d say he understands what good art is, as opposed to a lot of art dealers who just like to go to parties and do deals.” Still, he’s a main fixture of those “art-world parties” that “art and fashion scenester types” frequent, the outlet noted.</p><h2><strong>2. Cooke represents big name clients.</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>Although he keeps up a mysterious public persona — his private Instagram is currently just shy of 2,000 followers — Cooke’s clientele includes <strong>Lena Dunham’s</strong> father (<strong>Carroll Dunham</strong>), <strong>Anish Kapoor</strong>, <strong>Richard Prince</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>Bjork’s</strong> ex <strong>Matthew Barney</strong>,&nbsp;The Cut&nbsp;reported.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/jennifer-lawrence-spl-2-embed.jpg><h2><strong>3. He attended New York University.</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>He studied art history and economics, and was in the class of 2007, according to his Facebook page.</p><h2><strong>4. Cooke reportedly started dating Jennifer Lawrence in May 2018 after meeting through the actress’ BFF.</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>Cooke and Jennifer reportedly began dating after JLaw’s best friend, <strong>Laura Simpson</strong>, introduced them, according to a June 2018 <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>report</a> from&nbsp;Page Six. In a 2021 interview with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Vanity Fair</a>, Jennifer revealed her favorite part about marriage. “I really enjoy going to the grocery store with him,” Jennifer said. “I don’t know why but it fills me with a lot of joy. I think maybe because it’s almost a metaphor for marriage. ‘Okay, we’ve got this list. These are the things we need. Let’s work together and get this done.’ And I always get one of the cooking magazines, like&nbsp;15 Minute Healthy Meals, and he always gives me a look like, ‘You’re not going to use that. When are you going to make that?’ And I say, ‘Yes, I am. Tuesday!’ And he’s always right, and I never do.”</p><h2><strong>5. Cooke is from humble beginnings.</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>The art connoisseur hails from the rural Middlebury, Vermont, where his parents <strong>James Maroney</strong> and <strong>Suki Fredericks</strong> own the Oliver Hill Farm. They were once big-scale dairy farmers, but now rent their land to neighboring organic farmers, according to a 2015 profile from&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Medium</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2KwsLvKnmSmmaKku6bFjKOcp6aZm7KzecuarqudnpiybrTUrJmappRigHZ8kW5qbmc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
