The former Jersey Shore reality star celebrated her Sept. 9 engagement to her BF <strong>Louie Gero</strong> with a big bash at Grand Oaks Country Club on Nov. 19 on Staten Island, where they spent the special night toasting with their closest family and friends — and she didn’t wait for her wedding day to break out a white dress!</p><h3><a href=# rel=nofollow><span>Tis’ the Season: Shop Amazon’s Gift Guide Now</span></a></h3><p id=content-paragraph-5>Angelina got glam in a sparkling gown that showed off her curves. She wore her hair down in voluminous waves and accessorized with a jewel-encrusted headpiece, adding to the glam vibe of the ensemble — if this is her engagement party dress, we can only imagine what she plans to wear for her nuptials! Smoky eye makeup and major lashes rounded out the glam vibe as her future hubby looked just as dapper in a tuxedo and bow-tie. The couple and their friends took to Instagram to document the special night, sharing a slew of photos from the occasion.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>It definitely was a lavish affair and&nbsp;<strong>Myla Sinanaj</strong>, who is <strong>Kris Humphries</strong>‘ ex, was also in attendance as guests enjoyed a four-tier cake that featured rose petals and candles. Red accents were visible throughout the room, which was a nice touch for the November engagement party. In fact, at first glance, it almost looked like a wedding!</p><h3>PICS: The Most Lavish Celebrity Weddings</h3><p id=content-paragraph-7>Louie got down on one knee and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>proposed to his leading lady</a> on Sept. 9, after a fancy meal at the&nbsp;beautiful Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic.&nbsp;Myla shared their sweet moment via Instagram, writing,&nbsp;“Congrats to one of my best friends @angelinamtv on her engagement!!!!
