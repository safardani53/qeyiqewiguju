She is regarded as one of the most accomplished and influential models of all time, and has been featured on over 700 magazine covers. Evangelista is primarily known for being the longtime "muse" of photographer Steven Meisel, as well as for the phrase "We don't wake up for less than $10,000 a day." She holds the record for her multiple appearances on the cover of Vogue Italia, all of which were photographed by Meisel. Evangelista's modelling career began in 1984 when she signed with Elite Model Management after having moved from her native Canada to New York City. Upon the suggestion of photographer Peter Lindbergh, Evangelista had her hair cut short in 1988. The haircut, nicknamed "The Linda", not only sparked many copies worldwide, but it also benefited Evangelista's career and helped usher in the era of the supermodel.</p><table class=wikibox readability=8.5><tr readability=6><td class=wk_label>Born</td><td class=wk_value>May 10, 1965, St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Occupation</td><td class=wk_value>Supermodel</td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=wk_label>Years active</td><td class=wk_value>1983–1998 (retired), 2001–present</td></tr><tr readability=6><td class=wk_label>Partner(s)</td><td class=wk_value>Kyle MacLachlan (1992–1998), Fabien Barthez (1998–2000, 2001–2002), François-Henri Pinault (2005–2006)</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Children</td><td class=wk_value>1</td></tr><tr readability=2><td class=wk_label>Relatives</td><td class=wk_value>Christine Evangelista (cousin)</td></tr></table><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.allfamous.org/people/headshots/linda-evangelista-vve1-allfamous.org-1.jpg><p>Model Linda Evangelista was born on May 10, 1965 in Canada (She's 58 years old now).</p><p>Model from Canada who has featured on the covers of over 600 magazines.
