He later met his first wife Patricia Sue, an elementary school teacher, in West Germany. They wed in 1968 and had two boys together, Todd and Clayton.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After serving in the Vietnam War, he began to write novels and newspaper columns about his experiences following his honorable discharge in 1971. While living together, Michael and Patricia became close with their neighbors-turned-friends George and Elizabeth Ratliff.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 1983, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>George died from a military accident</a>, and in 1985, Elizabeth was found dead at the foot of her staircase with head injuries.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Michael and Patricia later divorced, and not long after, he moved in with telecoms exec Kathleen Atwater before eventually tying the knot in 1997.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2001, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Kathleen was found unconscious</a> at the bottom of their staircase in Durham, North Carolina — and was pronounced dead.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-crimes-did-michael-peterson-commit></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What crimes did Michael Peterson commit?</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Michael and Kathleen Peterson.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Netflix</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Michael was seemingly innocent at first as he was the one who dialed 911 after finding Kathleen at the base of their steps.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Detective Art Holland of Durham police</a>, Kathleen was "splayed out on the floor, her head resting on the landing of a back staircase" — details that sparked suspicion due to the awfully close similarities to Elizabeth's death in 1985.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Michael suggested that Kathleen fell down the stairs after drinking too much alcohol and Valium, but no fingerprints were detected on the wine bottle or glasses out in the kitchen.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kathleen was apparently bludgeoned to death after a medical examiner noticed several lacerations on her scalp. The dried blood atop her head was a clue that she'd been there for a while, and since Michael was the only person in the house at that time, he was the only suspect.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-was-michael-petersons-sentence></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What was Michael Peterson's sentence?</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Michael Peterson murder trial in July 2003.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Chuck Liddy/AP/Shutterstock</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The prosecution suggested that Michael killed his wife after they got in a fight supposedly initiated by Kathleen's discovery of more than 2,000 explicit images of men on Michael's computer — in addition to emails in conversation with a young male escort he was planning on reuniting with after meeting a few months prior.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The defense, however, disputed that Kathleen was accepting of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Michael's bisexuality</a> and that the blow poke (a hollow tube instead of a solid metal stick) he allegedly used to strike her suffered no damage, nor had any remnants of blood on it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On Oct. 10, 2003, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>the jury found Michael guilty of Kathleen's murder</a> and sentenced him to life without the possibility of parole.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-where-is-michael-peterson-now></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Where is Michael Peterson now?</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>AP/REX/Shutterstock</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A retrial was later ordered after the judge vacated the jury's verdict in 2011, finding that the blood splatter analysts gave a false and misleading testimony in the first trial, resulting in an unsound conviction.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2017, Michael submitted an Alford plea to voluntary manslaughter. This means that the person accused of murder can admit that there's enough evidence to convict them, but not admit guilty for committing the crime.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Michael was resentenced to 86 weeks in prison but was let free since he had already served more than that time. Currently, he resides in Durham, North Carolina — but has since sold the house where Kathleen died. (The house was on the market for $1.9 million, according to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>ABC 11 News</a>.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He had been living with his first wife, Patricia, (although divorced) for the past two years until her death from a heart attack, his son Clayton told North Carolina's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>News & Observer</a> in 2021.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"He's in a ground floor apartment with no stairs — that was a really important accommodation," Defense Attorney David Rudolf said of his former client at CrimeCon in New Orleans, per <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Oxygen</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5Ontq6xjrCfnqqVYra0ecyimqGZlaF6sbHTnqmsp55iu7DDjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
