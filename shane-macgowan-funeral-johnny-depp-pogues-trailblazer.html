He didn't want to talk about his own death, ever.</p><p>"He didn't believe he was going to die, ever. When I met Shane, when we got together, people started telling me that he would be dead within about six months because he was such a hard drinker."</p><p>She added: "He always assured me that he would live to be at least eighty.</p><p>"It took us by surprise. It took all of us by surprise, because we really did believe that he would come home. So it was a huge shock."</p><p>Victoria, who married Shane in 2018, said how he was “intensely religious”, added: “He was very grateful to be alive."</p><p>She also spoke of his forgiving nature and inability to “hold a grudge”.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>'FULL OF LOVE'</h2><p>Speaking on their love, she said: “He was just so full of love and I’m feeling so much love now from him that I don’t think he can go away.

And so Shane, with words from dad and I, your little sister and your father, we are so proud of you. So very proud of you, our darling.</p><p>"I told you I'd always love you, I always did and I always will."</p><p>In the homily, delivered by Father Pat Gilbert, mourners heard how MacGowan “had a depth and a sincerity that wasn't often picked up by people”.</p><p>Fr Gilbert said also told the congregation how MacGowan's widow Victoria Mary Clarke had cared for him until his death.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>'STRONG BONDS OF LOVE'</h2><p>He said: "I know he adored you Victoria and you him, and you were so loving, supportive and kind throughout your lives together. You carried and cared and caressed him right to the very end.</p><p>"I am also aware of the strong bonds of love and affection that knit you together as a family Maurice, Siobhan and Anthony. I know that you all will miss Shane terribly.</p><p>"A voice, a presence around you and with you, is suddenly silent - and coping with that loss is always difficult."</p><p>Fr Gilbert told how he grew up listening to “the music of Lizzy, the Horslips, the Rats, the Undertones and the Pogues”.</p><p>He said: "I grew up listening to the music of Lizzy, the Horslips, the Rats, the Undertones and The Pogues. As teenagers the music and the lyrics alerted us to what was happening around us. There was also the pride of being Irish, what they could say, sing and share was right and reasoned as far as we were concerned.</p><p>"In fact, Shane and The Pogues made it international and cool to play the tin whistle, banjo or accordion."</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>'TRAILBLAZER'</h2><p>Speaking about the iconic singer, he continued: "A poet, lyricist, singer, trailblazer, Shane reflected life as lived in our time, calling out accepted norms that oftentimes appear unacceptable. But, in order to speak, to be heard, and to have that revolutionary edge to life, the first step is to listen. And Shane listened.</p><p>"Mary’s character in the gospel story listens, and she is deemed to have chosen the better part. In listening she recognises the revolutionary Jesus who would eventually take mortality on, so life could have … ‘another round’.</p><p>"There Lazarus would feature in the prequel to his own resurrection. He listened to the plight of the sister’s grief. His listening morphed into something life-giving.</p><p>"Our poet, lyricist, singer and trailblazer, gave successive generations the benefit of his listening to the disquiet of life.</p><p>"Shane spoke and sang from the listened depths of his own journey and in doing so - as poets, lyricists and trailblazers do so well - he spoke to life’s realities for the many who are numbered as his fans. Life giving words.</p><p>"As for Martha, she responds to Jesus with those life-giving words: 'Yes, Lord, I believe that you are the Messiah’.”</p><p>“Your life gave growth to so many of us Shane, and your bright light gave salvation to our often dark and empty skies."</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>'NOT THE END'</h2><p>"'Not the end, not the end, just remember that death is not the end.'</p><p>"Rest in peace Shane.”</p><p>As the mass ended, pal Depp carried MacCowan's coffin out of the church as The Pogues sang The Parting Glass in memory of the iconic musician.</p><p>Earlier today, thousands of MacGowan fans lined the streets of Dublin as the Irish icon began his final journey home.</p><p>MacGowan’s funeral procession&nbsp;was driven through the south of the city - where Shane lived happily with wife Victoria for many decades - before heading to for the funeral mass in Tipperary.</p><p>The procession started from South Lotts Road and travelled down Pearse Street and onto Westland Row.</p><p>The horse-drawn carriage was accompanied by the Artane band and a lone piper who performed his hit songs in a special tribute.</p><p>Fans travelled from all over the country to say their final farewell to the singer and they could be heard singing some of his greatest hits throughout the procession.</p><p>This included Dirty Oldtown and Fairytale of New York.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Fans were also seen throwing flowers towards the hearse, draped in the tricolour, as it passed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.ie/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/12/99a581d9-e068-42a7-90ee-7780b7b32590.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.ie/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/12/NINTCHDBPICT000864950689.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.ie/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/12/NINTCHDBPICT000864941377-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.ie/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/12/NINTCHDBPICT000864941017-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.ie/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/12/NINTCHDBPICT000864943412.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2tmqaUqLWww8GisWhqZG6GdHyUcWasoJGjsm65wJyeqK%2BRo3qnwc2eqZqkXZ%2B8qbrNsmSdnaClerG7xq6crGWkp66quMGlmLOdomQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
