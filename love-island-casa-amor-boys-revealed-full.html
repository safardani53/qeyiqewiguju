"Leah is a very pretty girl but Jess’ personality is stand out for me. She can give good banter!"</p><p>His plan to win her over?</p><p>"I’m going to go in there and be my big, bubbly, cheeky self," he smiles.

"Kady interests me too, I watched her on Series 2 and she was a bit of a firecracker," he adds.</p><h2>Zachary Ashford</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/itv-plc-reproduced-editorial-purposes-828732147.jpg><p>Aged 27 from Manchester, Zach works in sales and promises he is in Casa Amor to "stir the pot" and "walk out with a girl I like".</p><p>Claiming he has "Northern charm" on his side, Zachary is looking for "loyalty", "humour" and a girl who is "family orientated".</p><p>He adds: "That brings a lot of great qualities to a person and something that I am passionate about because I come from a big family."</p><p>His main focus in Casa is Jess because he "gets a lot of good vibes from her", but he also calls Leah "beautiful looking" and claims Catherine has "something about her".</p><p>As for Kady, he says she is his "natural type" and "someone I would normally go for."</p><h2>Elom Ahlijah-Wilson</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/itv-plc-reproduced-editorial-purposes-828731333.jpg><p>22 year-old Londoner Elom is a masseuse and personal trainer.</p><p>"I want to ruffle a few feathers and to see if I can find a strong connection," he teases.</p><p>"I don’t beat around the bush, I don’t have a filter. If I don’t like you, I’m going to say it straight up. I’m confident. Looks wise, 10/10. Once I set myself a goal I always achieve it, always. There hasn’t been a time where I haven’t achieved it."</p><p>Elom also doesn't believe any of the existing couples will weather the storm.</p><p>"I don’t feel like any of them are strong," he insists. "I’ll be real with you. All their heads can be turned at the same time."</p><h2>Lochan Nowacki</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/itv-plc-reproduced-editorial-purposes-828731335.jpg><p>25 year-old Lochan is an Account Manager from Windsor.</p><p>"I feel like I’m excited because a lot of the people in relationships aren’t fully secure," he says of heading into Casa Amor. "I know the type of person I am as well, so I feel like I can turn heads."</p><p>"I can speak to anyone and hold a conversation. I’m quite a fun person, I like to let loose. I don’t really care so much what other people think about me as long as I’m enjoying myself, being respectful."</p><p>His top pick?</p><p>"My top is definitely Kady. She seems like a very grounded person, and has that mature side to her but you know she can have a lot of fun. I like her maturity compared to some of the other girls. She’s very much taking her time to build on relationships and speak to people. And she’s obviously gorgeous!"</p><h2>Benjamin Noel</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/itv-plc-reproduced-editorial-purposes-828731348.jpg><p>Aged 26, the fitness business owner from London describes himself as "funny, warm and I pride myself on respect."</p><p>He claims he will "thrive naturally" in the pressure cooker that is Casa Amor, and has his sights set on Leah.</p><p>"I don’t think she’s met her match yet, the traits she has are what I look for in a girl," he explains.</p><p>"I also like Kady, she’s really attractive so I want to figure out if we match in terms of our personalities. Whitney is another girl I’m drawn to, she’s a really cool girl."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p><strong>Love Island continues at 9pm on ITV2 and ITVX</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2ispmSFdYWYaWhvZ5ykw6Z5yKyjmqaUYrCiv8BmmKanomKvsMXSZqmerpWWuaawjJ%2BspaRf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
