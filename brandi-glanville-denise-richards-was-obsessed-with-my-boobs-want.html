That’s the question…</p><p>Delving into her first meetiing with Richards at Café Habana in Malibu last fall, Brandi told the aforementioned outlet that she felt Denise “wanted to hit it and quit it.”</p><p>As in: she just wanted to use Glanville for her breasts, vagina and other private parts and then immediately move on.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/cs_srgb><p>“She was very sexually aggressive and once she got what she wanted, she didn’t want to know,” <a href=#>Glanville said to start</a> her breakdown of the pair’s initial tryst, continuing as follows:</p><p><strong>We went to dinner and Denise is sitting across from me and the whole time she is looking at my boobs.</strong></p><p>Well, we suppose we can’t entirely blame her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Over the past few weeks, <a href=#>Glanville has claimed she has text messages</a> that prove this extramarital affair.</p><p>In reality, they don’t prove anything… at all.</p><p>But to her credit, Brandi certainly came equipped to this new interview with plenty of alleged information.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“Our agent left because it was getting late for him, but we stayed because we were having a great time, we were hitting it off,” Glanville explained of this same meal.</p><p>“And then Denise said to me; ‘Oh my God, does it seem like I’ve been looking at your boobs all night?’”</p><p>“I’m like, ‘yeah, pretty much.'”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>According to Glanville, Denise then simply asked to see her half-naked, a request Brandi granted. In semi-private.</p><p>“We went into the bathroom and I showed her my boobs and right when I took my shirt down.”</p><p>“She just kind of threw me against the wall and started making out with me,” Brandi said, emphasizing over and over that Richards was the aggressor.</p><p>“I was down for it, I honestly didn’t mind. I was like, okay, what are we doing, but this is fun,” she added.</p><p>The reality stars then returned to their table and kept drinking and this is when Richards really came right out with it.</p><p>“She said to me, ‘<strong>Oh my God, I always wanted to f-ck the sh-t out of you</strong>.’ And I was like, what?” Glanviille said.</p><p>“But I was going with it. I was having a good time.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>So back to the bathroom the women went — and this time, things got REALLY streamy, Brandi claims.</p><p>“We were just making out, I had jeans on,” she says, noting that no one got to third base, but …</p><p>“<strong>There was nothing other than like a little bit of titty sucking</strong>, but it was sexy.”</p><p>Wow.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Glanville previously told her fellow Real Housewives of Beverly Hills that <a href=#>she and Richards did everything</a>.</p><p>In this feature, she says Denise continually texted her after their bathroom-based foreplay sessions.</p><p>For what reason?</p><p>“She wanted to finish what she started, that’s how I felt. She was literally texting me every single day.</p><p>“Oh, I’m in your neighborhood, can I just come over? Can I come over? I need to see you.</p><p>“I said, well, ‘I can meet you for a drink, I can meet you at dinner.’”</p><p>“I just didn’t want to be alone with her, because I felt that she had a lot of dude energy, like she really wanted me.'”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Again, Glanville really hit the idea hard here that she was all innocent and naive and Richards simply wanted to bone.</p><p>“All I wanted was a new friend that I liked, that was cool and drank,” Brandi told The Daily Mail.</p><p>“I really was not looking for any kind of sexual partner, I felt like I was running from her.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Yes, she’s saying that Denise was trying to corner her like a dude would, and borderline take advantage of her in some way.</p><p>And yet, she was down, and at some point, the pair ended up in bed together, Glanville says, leaving all viewers to wonder:</p><p>Did this really happen?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Is Brandi lying or embellishing for attention? Or did Denise really want to absolutely rail her fellow housewife senseless?</p><p>And if Glanville truly just wanted a friend, how/why did she end up taking a trip to full-on Pound Town with Richards?</p><p>And, naturally, will Denise fire back any time soon in the wake of these very detailed new allegations?</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2toX2WGcK7RmqWdoV2cuaK61aKjpZ1dmbKvtdKeZKuhk52us7DSZq6aq12kr7Sx0qycnWWnnsGpecyyZJunn5fAbsPAp6to</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
