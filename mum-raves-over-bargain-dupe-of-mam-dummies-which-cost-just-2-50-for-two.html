My daughter will ONLY have Mam dummies, she rejects all the rest.</p><p>"We were in the car which she hates and I’d forgotten her dummy, stopped at Tesco and thought I’m not paying £6 for Mam ones, looked at the Fred & Flo ones which are £2.50 for 2 and they are the exact same!!!"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/NINTCHDBPICT000564237488.jpg><p>The thrifty mum shared photos of the two dummies side by side, and aside from the MAM logo imprinted on one, you couldn't tell them apart.</p><p>Many of the mums had already made the swap, agreeing that their child would only ever use the MAM version, until succeeding with Tesco's cheap find.</p><p>One mum said: "M<span dir=ltr><span class=_3l3x>y son will only have MAM but I discovered these the same way you did! So much cheaper, too."</span></span></p><p><span dir=ltr><span class=_3l3x>And a second person agreed:&nbsp; "My little boy would only have mam and I bought these a few weeks ago and he favours the Fred and Flo over mam now."</span></span></p><p>While another wrote: "I'm the same,&nbsp; [little] boy has about 59 different types of dummies and Fred and Flo or mam are only ones he accepts. Cheaper ones are identical to mam - that's a bargain and bonus in my eyes."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/KH-COMPOSITE-DUMMIES.jpg><ul><li><strong>MAM Silicone 0-6m Dummies, 2 pack from Boots, £5.75 - <a href=#>buy now&nbsp;&nbsp;</a></strong></li><li><strong>Fred & Flo Newborn Soothers, 2 Pack from Tesco, £2.50 - <a href=#>buy now</a></strong></li></ul><p>The post has proven popular within the group and now has over 2,000 likes, with almost the same amount in comments.</p><p>And for many mums who hadn't heard yet been aware of the more affordable buy, they were pleasantly surprised by idea of saving a buck or two.</p><p>One mum wrote: "Omg amazing. I’m going to go stock up I hate buying them as there so expensive but needed lol I will be off to buy these thanks."</p><p>And another said: "That's amazing! I didn't know that and my son uses them too and always loosing them ! It can be expensive! Not anymore, thank you!"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/NINTCHDBPICT000564253592.jpg><p>But while many thrilled mums successfully made the switch, some mums claimed their little ones still preferred MAM because of one small detail - the MAM logo.</p><p>One mum said:&nbsp;"&nbsp;<span dir=ltr><span class=_3l3x>I tried this with my [little girl] but she still had none of it all because the little square with mam in it wasn't there."</span></span></p><p>While another person said: "My baby knew the difference spat it out until it was mam"</p><p>And a third wrote: "I have these but the little bugger knows the difference he wont take them lol "</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN FABULOUS</h2></p><p>In more parenting news, we revealed this mum keeps her&nbsp;<a href=#>Christmas tree up all year round but gives it a makeover for each occasion</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, this mum has revealed her <a href=#>genius hack for making a full English in a slow cooker</a>.</p><p>Plus a furious six-year-old wrote a&nbsp;<a href=#>hilarious letter to the teacher that told him off</a>&nbsp;and people are calling him a hero.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Mum-of-three lets her children choose when to sleep and eat and teaches them reading with Minecraft</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5BpcHJsZWaDcLnUpmSrmaaawG671Z6pZpqRp7Sitc1mm66olWK8p3nMmqRmnKWiuqqx0mauoaGTnXqku9KtZKOto6l6c3mUaWSfp6Jiwbi7jg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
