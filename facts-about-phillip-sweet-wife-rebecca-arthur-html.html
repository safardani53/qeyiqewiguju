So, here we have compiled a few facts about the enigmatic Rebecca Jane Sweet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>She Is a Humanitarian Activist</h2><p>Rebecca, with her husband Phillip, is an activist working for cancer awareness. It all&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">started</a>&nbsp;when she visited St. Jude Children's Research Hospital at an undisclosed time. The celebrated musician's wife did, however, disclose her support for the kids, parents, nurses, and doctors she met at the hospital.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She has since been a promoter of an organization called "This Shirt Saves Lives." The foundation sells merchandise which in turn funds and supports kids fighting cancer at St. Jude. The rockstar has also made <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">appearances</a> on Rebecca's Instagram supporting the Stand Up To Cancer movement. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Mother to A Sweet&nbsp;Daughter</h2><p>Phillip and Rebecca <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">tied the knot</a> on March 27, 2007, and were blessed with a beautiful baby daughter by the end of the year. Their daughter Penelopi Jane was born on December 27, 2007.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>On the occasion of Penelopi's eleventh birthday, the loving mother took to her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a> to share a memorable snap. The decade-old photo featured the Sweet couple holding baby Penelopi. The father dressed in a black shirt with Buddha print shared the hospital bed with the new mother, who was wearing a hospital gown. All the while, the&nbsp;adorable daughter was asleep in Phillip's arms.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Vocal on Gun Restriction</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Rebecca has also been active in <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">voicing</a> her opinions against gun violence and restriction. In one of her Instagram posts, she was also seen protesting for gun control in the March For Our Lives movement. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>"Today, I marched for my daughter, my cousins, my nieces, and my nephews," she wrote in the captions. The said post included a rally of people, amongst which an older woman stood out. The woman was holding a board that read, "PROTECT OUR GRANDCHILDREN NOT ASSAULT RIFLES."&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>On that note, she also sent her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">prayers</a> to the victims of the infamous Las Vegas shooting of 2017. The post was as much a call to action as it was a prayer.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>I am choosing to be part of the change, and I choose not to live in fear of evil. Let's stand as one, and figure this out. We cannot allow this anymore.</p><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>She Grew Up Dyslexic</h2><p>Gun control and cancer awareness aren't the only social causes that Rebecca supports. Having been a dyslexic child herself, she is also working towards <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">educating</a> people about the condition. In 2017, she also shared a small clip that explained how dyslexic people think differently than your average Joe and how that thought process could blossom into new science, music, philosophy, or art.</p><p>The post urged its viewers to change their predisposition to the "learning disability" and gave&nbsp;those suffering from this condition a new outlook on life. The video shared was initially posted by the globally renowned innovator Richard Branson.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinqKiloa6ze8Wamq2rXZavsMHTZqehoZyhtrF50rCcnqxdrLansYyrnJudk5iubq3RrZ%2Buql6dwa64</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
