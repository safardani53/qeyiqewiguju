In acclaimed filmmaker Luca Guadagnino's long-awaited film <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bones and All</a>, viewers meet a young woman named Maren (Taylor Russell) who falls in love with an enigmatic stranger known as Lee (<a href=#>Timothée Chalamet</a>).</p><p>OK, this sounds like your <a href=#>typical rom-com</a> ... but that's actually far from the truth.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In an unexpected turn of events, Maren and Lee share a taste for human flesh — wait, what?! Yes, you read that right. The flick, which is <a href=#>based on the 2015 novel of the same name</a>, tells the story of two young cannibalistic lovers who embark on a cross-country road trip. From there, they struggle to live in a society that doesn't accept them.</p><p>This sounds rather horrific, so is Bones and All scary? Let's find out.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, is 'Bones and All' scary?</h2><p>Although the sight of blood makes us light-headed, we will still be running to see Bones and All.</p><p>Now, the film will definitely have its fair share of horror and scary elements; however, it's more moderate compared to the 2022 splatter slasher film <a href=#>Terrifier 2</a>, which left audiences fainting and vomiting in the back of ambulances. Nevertheless, this movie is not for the squeamish — in fact, there are many explicit scenes showing human cannibalism.</p><p>When it comes to the critics, many agree that it's quite gory. Aramide A. Tinubu of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Shadow and Act</u></a> said the gore is "genuinely horrific," while Meagan Navarro of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloody Disgusting</a> noted that "the gore and cannibalism will likely repulse mainstream or unsuspecting audiences."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"Guadagnino’s film is artful and tender, if occasionally almost too tense and brutal to bear," added Pulitzer Prize finalist Stephanie Zacharek from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Time</a>. "Watching it — waiting to see where it was going to end up, and finding myself in thrall to one performance in particular — I wondered if this film might haunt me forever."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>She continued, "But after it was over, I found I could shake its spell easily. Bones and All is fastidiously romantic. It’s so carefully made, and so lovely to look at, even at its grisliest, that it ends up seeming a little remote, rather than a movie that draws you close." Wow, we really hope to walk away with the same perspective because the gore is getting to us right now.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why is 'Bones and All' rated R?</h2><p>According to the film's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">official IMDb parents guide page</a>, Bones and All is rated R for "strong, bloody and disturbing violent content, language throughout, some sexual content and brief graphic nudity."</p><p>Bones and All is now in theaters.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBurs6nnKxlkaOxbq3LpWSsm5Gnxg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
