He also worked as a technical supervisor for the majority of Ax Men, a show about the logging industry that aired on History from 2008 to 2016.</p><p>According to singer-songwriter Vinnie James, Zac even served as inspiration for his tune "Always a Rebel," which has been used on Deadliest Catch.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"The 'wavin' my fist' line in the song is written for (and about) Zac McFarlane, [Director] of Photography on the Deadliest Catch," Vinnie previously revealed. "I was in the process of writing the song and one night, Josh Harris (from the Cornelia Marie), and Zac came into the lobby of the Grand Aleutian Hotel, where I was staying during my time in Dutch Harbor last season."</p><p>The folk artist continued, "Josh sat down in the seat [next] to me and starting telling me how Zac had gone out on the deck of the Cornelia Marie after filming one night, during a raging October Bering Sea storm, deck pitching all over the place, rigging howling, waving his fists at the torment, shouting: 'Is that all you got? Bring it on!!!'... very cool... I just HAD to write a line in the song memorializing that story."</p><p>Our thoughts are with Zac’s family as they continue to mourn this devastating loss.
