The <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>wedding/event planner</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>mother of two</a> has gotten into it with Adriana, all the while organizing Alexia’s wedding and opening up about a past family tragedy. Safe to say, Guerdy’s made an impact!</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Guerdy talked all about her reality TV debut in an EXCLUSIVE interview with <strong>HollywoodLife</strong>. She even teased that there’s “crazy” drama coming on the remaining episodes and at the reunion, which the cast already filmed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Guerdy-Abraira-RHOM-Fans-Flip-Reunion-Peacock-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4><strong><i>HOLLYWOODLIFE: Were you&nbsp;hesitant at all to&nbsp;join ‘RHOM’ once you got the call from producers?</i></strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-5><strong>GUERDY</strong> <strong>ABRAIRA</strong>: It’s&nbsp;funny, because my initial reaction was, ‘Oh, this is meant to be.’ And then when I started to think through the whole thing I’m like, ‘Well what is this? What is that?’ And all the lies that could ruin my reputation. But I’m a good person. I’m a hard worker. So I decided to definitely take a leap of faith.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6><strong><i>HOLLYWOODLIFE: Did you find it difficult to break into the group, since most of these ladies (<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Marysol</a>, Alexia, <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Lisa</a>, etc.) have&nbsp;been friends for years?</i></strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-7><strong>GUERDY</strong> <strong>ABRAIRA:&nbsp;</strong>Absolutely. It’s always hard, whether you’re on a show or not. Just given the fact that they all cling to each other and then years later, here you are trying to reboot, the pressure was on. So I feel like they may have just clinged on to each other initially for moral support important, and then things evolved when we got to know each other. A lot of things have changed today, that’s for sure.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8><strong><i>HOLLYWOODLIFE: We’ve seen you bicker with Adriana a few times this season, including at the birthday party you threw for Julia [Lemigova]. Why&nbsp;didn’t you guys see eye-to-eye?</i></strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-9><strong>GUERDY ABRAIRA:&nbsp;</strong>Adriana had the most conflict with me, than I did with her. What’s happening is she felt intimidation obviously with Julia and I’s relationship. There’s a couple dinners and lunches that we went to without her. And I think that she went into Mother Bear mode and defended her status with Julia in such a way that was not the way I would have handled it. She tried to come for my design skills, which was interesting. And so, it all evolved into what it is now. I think she realized that maybe her approach was not the best.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Guerdy-Abraira-RHOM-Fans-Flip-Reunion-Peacock-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-10><strong>HOLLYWOODLIFE</strong>:&nbsp;<i><strong>What do you make of Larsa? Did your opinions of her change once you got to know&nbsp;each other during filming?</strong></i></p><p id=content-paragraph-11><strong>GUERDY ABRAIRA</strong>: Larsa, to me, is a caring person, driven. I think she’s got a lot to prove to herself and to her family and so forth. I think it’s amazing <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>how good of a mother she is.</a> Her motherhood is really respectable. I think that’s amazing. She was with this guy [her ex-husband, <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Scottie Pippen</strong></a>] for many years. That is in itself someone who is loyal. I find her to have great personality traits, and she’s a fun girl.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12><strong>HOLLYWOODLIFE:&nbsp;</strong><strong><i>You’ve briefly opened up on the show&nbsp;about your brother and two of his kids who died in the 2010 Haiti earthquake. Were you nervous about discussing that on camera?</i></strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-13><strong>GUERDY ABRAIRA</strong>: 100%.&nbsp;Some people don’t understand the depth of that sorrow. I started to want to share, but then I realized that again, some people are not ready to have that depth of conversation. So I kind of retracted from that. In good time, hopefully in the future, it’ll be a moment I can share with them in detail. But to be honest, that is a very low point in my life. It’s not something I like to spit out and say to people all the time. I live everyday for those who unfortunately are no longer with us and they are my motivation. So I have angels that have my back. I’m a lucky girl.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-14><strong>HOLLYWOODLIFE:&nbsp;</strong><strong><i>What can tease about the rest of the season? There looks to be more drama going on in the Hamptons.</i></strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-15><strong>GUERDY ABRAIRA</strong>: There’s quite a lot of things that are going to happen. <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>You guys already saw the teaser</a> with the infamous bachelorette party. <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>It gets crazy</a>. It’s volatile. I try to help out. The wheels keep on moving between Adriana and Larsa. Adriana and Julia have some incredible moments together. I think the viewers will be quite entertained.</p><p id=content-paragraph-16><strong>HOLLYWOODLIFE:&nbsp;</strong><strong><i>And then comes the reunion, which you have already filmed. Were you nervous going into it? And now that it’s over, what can you spill?</i></strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-17><strong>GUERDY ABRAIRA</strong>: I feel great about how it turned out. It was nerve-racking for sure. I didn’t know who was gonna come with receipts, and I definitely was ready with mine. But you guys are gonna flip out when you see some of the stuff that happens. It’s quite theatrical. You’ll see what I mean.</p><p id=content-paragraph-18>Want more?
