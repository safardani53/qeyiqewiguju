It is worth it because I think that of course I want to disassociate in specific thoughts and things being said because that is not me,” the Hulu personality said on the “Angie Martinez IRL” podcast in December 2022. “But at the same time in my home I could be going through something, but if we are riding to school and they want to listen to their dad’s music — no matter what we are going through — I have to have that smile on my face and blast his music and sing along with my kids. [I can] act like nothing is wrong and as soon as I drop them off, I can have a good cry.”</p><p>The “Stronger” performer also opened up <a href=#>about how he and the Skims founder work together</a> to raise their children.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Even to this day, I’ll still give Kim advice on things that could help because that’s going to go to the kids,” he said on the “Alo Mind Full” podcast in September 2022. “She’s still got them 80 percent of the time, [to] raise those children. So what people saw when I was going back and forth is that I still have to be able to throw my version of what people would throw into the curriculum.”</p><p>Scroll down to see West and Censori’s full relationship timeline:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkuKK62J5ksJ2jqXqjtcCnmpplk5q7tLvRoqpmqpWhrrW1zqeqoaGgYsGqucSloKedXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
