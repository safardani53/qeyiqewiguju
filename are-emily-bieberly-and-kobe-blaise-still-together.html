This week’s episode saw Kobe snap, telling Emily to &#34;shut the f–k up&#34; in front of her mom after she got bossy."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Kobe is not one of them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Emily felt that she was being "helpful" by telling Kobe how to do things faster so that they could move on to something else.</p><p>Kobe felt that she was being patronizing and annoying.</p><p>Neither of them communicated their feelings very well to each other. They became abrasive, hurt each other’s feelings, and then things got worse:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>There are simply no circumstances, outside of perhaps some specific bedroom role play, when you should tell your partner to "shut the f–k up."</p><p>Kobe wasn’t responding to a joke or a funny story — he was demanding that Emily stop speaking to him, as rudely as possible.</p><p>This kind of line would very reasonably end friendships. It’s an outrageous way to speak to one’s fiancee … especially in front of her mom, but also in private.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Emily was shocked, and she told the camera as much before going inside.</p><p>She had never before witnessed this side of Kobe, not in their two months in China and not in their long-distance relationship.</p><p>Is this how he is going to react during future disagreements?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>In the stable, Kobe very awkwardly spoke to Lisa, Emily’s mom.</p><p>Kobe seemed to miss the nuance of how rude and hostile what he had said to his fiancee had been.</p><p>He wondered if this conflict had to do with them coming from different cultures with different gender roles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Lisa was able to gently steer Kobe in another direction, helping him to understand her daughter’s reaction a bit better.</p><p>This wasn’t about how men and women speak in the US so much as about how one person speaks to another.</p><p>She noted that her husband would never, ever speak to her the way that Kobe had just spoken to Emily.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>When Kobe went in, the two offered each other half-apologies.</p><p>Emily didn’t seem to grasp how bossy she had been.</p><p>Kobe was more apologetic, but still didn’t give the impression that he understood the line that he had crossed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Before these recent disagreements, most of the conflict that we saw had more to do with the viewing audience.</p><p>Baited by the production crew and editors, misogynistic trolls have been frothing at the mouths with hatred for Emily.</p><p>From (gasp!) being honest about her sexual history with Kobe to (no!) breastfeeding her son, she made an easy target for a certain portion of viewers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>But are Emily and Kobe still together? We know that this was all filmed many months ago — likely late last year.</p><p>Many, but not all, of us would consider "shut the f–k up" an absolute relationship dealbreaker no matter what, though clearly this is not the case for Emily.</p><p>Could they still be together after multiple disputes and an exchange of such harsh words?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Last month, Kobe and Emily hinted that they are still together.</p><p>Kobe gave a shoutout on Mother’s Day, praising all moms but singling out Emily by saying "I still got this wonderful woman."</p><p>Emily reinforced the hint by telling him that she loves him in a comment, as you can see above. It certainly appears that they were still together very recently.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>To complicate matters, however, Kobe made a vague post to Instagram after Episode 8 aired.</p><p>"Know your worth and never feel bad to break a relationship or leave a place where you’re not appreciated," he wrote.</p><p>"Some people are in your life for a reason," he offered, "while others are there for a season."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"And," Kobe continued, "most of the times those seasonal people in your life will make you feel like you can’t survive without them."</p><p>He advised: "Remember God does not only bless people financially, taking someone out of your can also be a blessing. We move"</p><p>It sounds like a generic piece of advice … but is it a hint that he and Emily are over? Only time will tell.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tqX2WDcK3RnmSepZmhxm6uyJ6ZnqqcrnqiusNmoqialWKvra3IrJxmq6Seua1506ienqyYmr9w</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
