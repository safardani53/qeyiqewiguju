A number of cylinders were in the garden centre which is why a 300 metre hazard zone was set up as cylinders can explode when exposed to heat.</p><p>"Quick thinking firefighters were able to drag the majority of the cylinders away from the fire which prevented a possible explosion. Then firefighters used covering jets to cool the remaining cylinders down.</p><p>"Fireworks were also being stored at the garden centre but again, firefighters hosed the storage area down to ensure they did not&nbsp;can catch alight.</p><p>"Most of the garden centre building has been damaged by the fire but crews were able to contain it and prevent any further spread. Thankfully nobody has been injured in this fire."</p><br><p><strong>Read more:</strong></p><p><a href=#>Major air disaster narrowly averted over London after drone nearly collides with passenger plane near The Shard</a></p><p><a href=#>‘Killer clown brandishing a fake gun’ arrested by Heathrow Airport cops</a></p><p><a href=#>British Airways flight from Baltimore to London ‘declares emergency’ in bound to Heathrow</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZ39zg5dsa2iemaeybrTEmquhqp%2BseqK10ammq6xdlru0sculZKCZopmyr3nCnqWtqpVk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
