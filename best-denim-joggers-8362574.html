Like Rag & Bone, the brand is known for its high-quality jeans. These jean joggers from Mother are no exception. They are well-made and have lots of stretch, making them worth the investment despite their high price. These joggers look like actual denim jeans with their flattering light wash, zip fly with button closure, and four-pocket styling. The use of cotton, lyocell, polyester, and elastane materials in the production of jeans, however, makes them softer than actual jeans.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Appelt loves these jeans because of their tailored silhouette, color, and the size of the pockets.

Still, they're extremely comfortable and soft enough to put your sweatpants and leggings on the back burner.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range: </strong>0-26 | <strong>Materials:</strong> 100% linen | <strong>Color Options:&nbsp;</strong>4</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-wide-leg-maurices-kancan-superhigh-rise-drawstring-wide-leg-jean></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Wide-Leg</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Maurices KanCan Wide Leg Jean</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Maurices KanCan SuperHigh Rise Drawstring Wide Leg Jean" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/e3xVrQDUDuunz6xOuvHSOpiEdHQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/maurices-kancan-superhigh-rise-drawstring-wide-leg-jean-b2c6e36875fa42d5b6899298a54ab555.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Maurices</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While not your classic tapered-ankle jogger silhouette, these wide-leg joggers give your outfit an elevated feel while still being extremely comfortable. It is a full-length style&nbsp;with a premium, rigid, non-stretch fabric and a functional drawstring at the top that gives it a sporty look. There are also functional side pockets and a double button and zip fastening to keep the style secure.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This jogger only comes in one medium sandblast color, but it’s not lacking in style. The wide legs (which sit relaxed at the hip from thigh to hem) give them a sophisticated look, while the drawstring keeps them from looking too dressy. You can wear them with all sorts of wardrobe staples, including white tees, chunky knits, or a halter top. Reviewers also recommend pairing it with a crop top or bodysuit for a seamless look. FYI: For petite women, it's recommended to choose one size smaller when buying these joggers due to the adjustable waistband and roomy design.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range</strong>: 24-30 | <strong>Material:</strong> 100% cotton | <strong>Color Options</strong>: 1</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-flare-freckled-poppy-boutique-risen-dark-wash-jogger-flares></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Flare</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Freckled Poppy Boutique Risen Jogger Flares</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Freckled Poppy Boutique Risen Dark Wash Jogger Flares" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/BAg7q8fYh151kZdpM34yNWnWDyk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/freckled-poppy-boutique-risen-dark-wash-jogger-flares-0a7e1e0c5b254d62ad5b19c5c08f6448.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Freckled Poppy Boutique</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Looking to add some retro vibes to your wardrobe? Michelle suggests these denim joggers that have a nice length and flare out at the end. They're available in a medium wash with nice graining and have a drawstring at the waist, which adjusts the tightness. These joggers are made with a blend of cotton, polyester, and spandex materials and are available in sizes up to 3X. They also have a true-to-size fit with some added stretch.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Michelle notes that these joggers can be worn by women of all sizes, whether tall or short. “If you're tall, have fun by pairing them with an oversized top and stylish booties,” she recommends. “For petite folks, a fitted or cropped top works best with these pants to keep the proportions just right.” A word to the wise: These jeans are available in odd sizes, so to find the perfect fit, the brand recommends taking your even size and subtracting it by one.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range: </strong>1-3X | <strong>Material: </strong>93% cotton, 6% polyester and 1% spandex<strong> </strong>|<strong> Color Options:&nbsp;</strong>1</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-belted-free-people-amsterdam-belted-high-waist-wide-leg-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Belted</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Free People Amsterdam High Waist Wide Leg Jeans</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Nordstrom Free People Amsterdam Belted High Waist Wide Leg Jeans" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/0thEHHKhVvA7yz_YHdkRQiSdb4c=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/free-people-amsterdam-belted-high-waist-wide-leg-jeans-499ddb8678284f0db360ee71273a542e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These belted denim joggers from Free People feature a boho silhouette, high rise, and paper bag waistband, making them perfect for elevating your off-duty look. They come with wide legs, a removable belt, and topstitching that contrasts with the fabric.

And the same goes for denim joggers too, because, as Appelt tells PEOPLE, you'll want to opt for styles that offer a comfortable yet complementary fit. “Look for options with a loose or slim fit, depending on your body type,” she says. “If you're curvier, you may want a slimmer fitting pair that will show off your figure; if you're more of a rectangular or inverted triangle shape, a loose-fitting pair of sweatpants will give you some shape and movement.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Appelt adds that the length of your denim joggers is just as important as the style: too long, and they won't flatter your body type. For those who are shorter, stick with ankle-length joggers to ensure the silhouette is not overpowering and to allow for your shoes to make a statement as well.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Fabric<strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to denim joggers, the fabric is like the personality of the joggers — it can greatly affect their performance. So, if you want to be comfortable and move with ease, Appelt recommends choosing a high-quality denim with a blend of stretch material.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Waistband Width</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Jean sweatpants often feature elastic or drawstring waistbands to give them a sporty look, but don't forget to pay attention to the width of the waistband, as it can affect the fit of the sweatpants. Appelt suggests a thicker waistband for full figures to help smooth out the lower torso.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Styling</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Appelt also recommends thinking about how you can mix and match denim joggers with other items in your wardrobe. “I always tell my clients to think about three ways they can wear something when making a purchase,” she says. This way, if you only foresee the joggers being feasible in one outfit or look, then you probably won't get a lot of wear out of them and they won't be as worthy of an investment.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Wash and Color&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you're wondering how to style denim joggers, Appelt recommends paying attention to the wash and color which can really impact the overall vibe of your outfit. “Dark washes are versatile and can be dressed up or down, while lighter washes are more casual,” she explains. Appelt also suggests that distressed or faded options can give a more fashionable look, so it's important to consider your style and how you want to wear them.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-faq-8c39952e-1770-41f0-8764-ac8f94b961c4></span><p>Frequently Asked Questions</p><ul id=mntl-sc-block-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-faq__content mntl-accordion" readability=50><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>What are denim joggers called?</span></p><p>While different fashion brands often create their own names for them, "denim joggers," "denim sweatpants," "denim athletic pants," "denim sweatpants" and "denim jogger jeans" are all names for the same thing, according to fashion stylist Brooke Rounick.

That is the question. But if you ask Rounick, the answer is a resounding yes. “Sometimes more expensive options offer benefits such as better fabric quality, attention to detail, and craftsmanship that can contribute to their longevity,” she tells PEOPLE. However, it's not always necessary to spend a lot of money to find a good quality jogger, and there are many options with different prices."
