This has provided managers with an excellent opportunity to iron out specific issues and prepare for the demanding schedule of club football.</p><p>This season, certain top teams have thrived at the highest level. These teams, led by world-class players, have done well so far, despite the fact that the season is long and will undoubtedly be full of surprises.</p><p>However, a few players have set the bar high with their outstanding performances this season. In this article, we look at the world’s ten most valuable players as of November 2021.</p><h2>Number 5: Mohamed Salah – £90,000,000</h2><p>Right now, <strong>Mohamed Salah</strong> is the best player in the world. Only Karim Benzema and Robert Lewandowski can argue against that assertion.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Mohamed-Salah.jpg><p>Salah has appeared in 11 Premier League games this season, scoring 10 goals and assisting six others. These numbers appear incredible on paper, but given that Salah has been world-class for quite some time, few are surprised by his effectiveness.</p><p>This season, the Egypt international has looked unplayable at times and has regularly been toying with opposing defenses thanks to his quick feet and pace.</p><p>The 29-year-old is a game-changing superstar who will undoubtedly go down as a modern-day Liverpool legend. Salah’s current Liverpool contract expires in 2023, and fans are hoping for a quick renewal. If he decides to leave Liverpool, he will not be short of suitors.</p><h2>Number 4: Jack Grealish – £90 million</h2><p>It was unsurprising to see Manchester City sign Aston Villa’s <strong>Jack Grealish</strong> for nearly £106 million this summer. The club had been linked with him for some time before the move.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Jack-Grealishjj.jpg><p>Grealish is one of the Premier League’s most promising young players. The 26-year-old is a skilled game technician who can cause havoc with his creativity and dribbling ability. Grealish, who can play in midfield and further forward, is in many ways the ideal Pep Guardiola player.</p><p>This season, the England international has made nine Premier League appearances, scoring one goal and assisting on two others. Grealish has yet to adapt to Guardiola’s high demands fully, but he has already put in some good performances for his new club.</p><h2>Number 3: Harry Kane – £108 million</h2><p><strong>Harry Kane</strong> has had a disastrous start to the new Premier League season. So far in the league, he has only scored one goal.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Harry-Kane.jpg><p>Many consider Kane to be the best striker in the world. The England international, a complete forward capable of both creating and finishing chances, has not fully demonstrated his abilities this season. Kane was heavily linked with a move to Manchester City this summer, and one has to wonder how much the failed transfer has affected his performances.</p><p>The appointment of Antonio Conte as a manager should be viewed favorably. Kane has been vocal about his desire to win trophies, and Conte’s appointment should be seen as a step in the right direction by the 28-year-old.</p><h2>Number 2: Erling Braut Haaland&nbsp; – £135 million</h2><p>In recent years, <strong>Erling Braut Haaland</strong> has emerged as one of the game’s rising stars. Some of the game’s biggest clubs are interested in the striker.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Erling-Haaland.jpg><p>At Borussia Dortmund, Haaland has been a revelation. The Bundesliga club signed the 21-year-old from Red Bull Salzburg for £18 million in 2020. Since his arrival, the striker has made 69 appearances in all competitions for the Germans, scoring 70 goals and providing 19 assists.</p><p>This summer, the Norwegian international was linked with a move away from Borussia Dortmund, with Chelsea being mentioned as a possible destination. However, the move did not go as planned, and he was forced to remain in Germany.</p><p>On the other hand, Haaland is unlikely to play for Borussia Dortmund next season. Manchester United, Manchester City, Real Madrid, and Barcelona are all rumored to be interested in signing him in the summer of 2022.</p><h2>Number 1:&nbsp; Kylian Mbappe – £144 million</h2><p><strong>Kylian Mbappe</strong>, along with Erling Braut Haaland, is regarded as the heir apparent to Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi’s thrones.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kylian-Mbappe-1.jpg><p>Mbappe has already established himself as one of the best players in the world. The France international is a club and country star known for his pace, dribbling, and finishing ability. Mbappe has 139 goals and 72 assists in 187 appearances for PSG across all competitions.</p><p>Mbappe, like Haaland, is unlikely to return to his current club next season. The 22-year-contract old’s with PSG expires next summer, and Real Madrid appears to be his likely next destination. Mbappe is eager to join Los Blancos, and the move is expected to happen soon.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGirqKhdanquu9KtZK%2BZnKquo7jEZqelmamav7R5yKdkraCVYsSwvsudZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
