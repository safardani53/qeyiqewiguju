By any imaginable metric I don’t deserve this, but thank you,” the Kentucky native said on stage. “I never thought of myself as somebody who’d win this award. I’m so grateful for each and every person who works so hard to make us able to do what we do — my wife Morgane, thank you. I want to say, my kids sitting at home, they give up a lot of my time, a lot of my wife’s time so we can do this. This is for them.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>So, who is Morgane?

She’s the voice of reason because I’m not always reasonable.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>He went on to say that she coaches him to improve, and her expertise is a big help. “She’s been known to make me change keys on something,” he said. “She’ll be like, ‘Sing higher.’ I’m like, ‘Alright.’ I get lazy on keys sometimes. I’ll key it lower. That way I can sing it lower live. She won’t let me get lazy on stuff like that. She knows when I’m doing it, and nobody else does.”</p><h2>She’s a mother of 5, including a set of twins.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/chris-stapleton-Morgane-Stapleton-shutter-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-9>The Stapletons are famously protective of their children and don’t share a lot of information about them.
