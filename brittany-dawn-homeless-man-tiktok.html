In 2019, she acted as a fitness instructor and self-purported nutritionist who offered various exercise services through her own company. Later that same year, many of her customers alleged that although they had paid her properly, Brittany never followed through on any of her services. Several years after issuing a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">public apology</a> on YouTube over the controversy, she completely rebranded her image and became a Christian influencer.</p><p>Yet even in this role, controversy would continue to follow her. Throughout 2021, Brittany documented her efforts in helping a homeless man named <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">James</a>. Reportedly, he had visited a church to donate the $0.15 he had left to his name as a sign of goodwill. Brittany was so moved by this gesture that she and her husband provided him with a home in a hotel, food, and clothes, all while convincing him to join their church.</p><p>Unfortunately, this supposedly kind gesture may have been a ruse.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">A TikToker reveals details about Brittany's alleged GoFundMe scam.</h2><p>In late December 2022, Harriet Berholtz aka <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@leaveittoharriet</a> posted a TikTok that details the supposedly dishonest nature behind Brittany Dawn's interactions with James. Harriet discusses a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">GoFundMe campaign</a> that Brittany began back in 2021 to raise money for James to receive treatment for his addiction at a rehab facility. The campaign raised more than $25,000 while it was up.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>According to Harriet, however, the facility that James was sent to was a free Christian clinic with no medical experts on staff that subjects its inpatients to "forced labor" as a way of working through substance withdrawals.</p><p>Having spent little of the money raised from GoFundMe, Brittany would reportedly cut ties with James completely after his "rehab" was completed.</p><p>To make matters worse, Brittany would later post pictures of an expensive-looking wedding that she held for her 2021 marriage.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Though no official correlation has been confirmed between the GoFundMe campaign debacle and Brittany's lavish wedding ceremony, it isn't difficult for social media users to put the pieces together given her history of fraudulent behavior in the past.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl7%2BqwNOapbJllJbEr3nHqKSepJWowG65wKdkraGbqbys</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
