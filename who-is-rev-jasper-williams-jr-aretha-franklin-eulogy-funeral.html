Jasper Williams Jr.</strong>, 75, for the honor before passing away on Aug.&nbsp;16 at the age of 76 from pancreatic cancer. The revered pastor will deliver the deceased queen’s&nbsp;eulogy at her funeral in the Greater Grace Temple in Detroit, Michigan on Aug. 31. He will be closing out the final hour of her life celebration, right before a final musical tribute by <strong>Stevie Wonder</strong>, 68, and the recessional. Learn why this pastor, who has a surprising connection to Aretha, was picked for the job!</p><p id=content-paragraph-3><strong>1. Rev. Jasper has a jaw-dropping number of church followers.&nbsp;</strong>He is the Senior Pastor of Salem Bible Church, with two locations in Georgia: Atlanta and Lithonia. The locations combined boast a whopping 10,000 members, the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>church</a> reported in 2017.&nbsp;The pastor also has two honorary Doctor of Divinity degrees.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4><strong>2. The pastor grew up with Aretha!&nbsp;</strong>His family and Aretha’s were very close. His brother, uncle and Aretha’s father, <strong>Rev.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>C.L. Franklin</strong>, all came from the state of Mississippi, the pastor shared during an Aug. 28 interview on&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>WAOK-AM</a>.&nbsp;Furthermore, Aretha’s dad and the pastor’s uncle,<strong> Alton Roosevelt Williams</strong>, were best friends,&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>AJC</a>&nbsp;reported. From that friendship came another important relationship for the pastor.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5><strong>3. This isn’t the first time he’s delivered a eulogy for a Franklin.&nbsp;</strong>Rev. Jasper’s son called Rev. C.L. his dad’s “long-time mentor.” So it was only appropriate that Rev. Jasper delivered the eulogy for Aretha’s father, whom was also heavily involved with church as a minister, at his funeral on Aug. 11, 1984.&nbsp;“My admiration, love and respect for Dr. Franklin is infinite. In other words, there are no boundaries. There are no limitations. And so I feel like what I was privileged to have done 34 years ago when I preached his funeral August the eleventh, I think it was, 1984,” Rev. Jasper shared in a Facebook video that his son <strong>Rev. Joseph L. Williams</strong> posted to his Facebook. “God put a comma there. To me and in my mind at the time, it was a period. It was the end of the greatest anticipation of what I ever wanted to do as a preacher. But when Aretha asked me to do her home going, I see God taking that period, putting the line down. Making it a pause or a comma at the time that [C.L.] Franlkin passed.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6><strong>4. He’s a decorated singer himself.</strong>&nbsp;The pastor has won an Award of Excellence from the Gospel Music Workshop of America, among other awards. His eulogy for Aretha’s father,&nbsp;the LP entitled&nbsp;A Good Soldier, reached the number 24 spot on&nbsp;Billboard’s&nbsp;Top Gospel Albums in 1985.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7><strong>5. The pastor has been preaching since the age of six — yes, really!</strong>&nbsp;Rev. Jasper recently celebrated his 60th anniversary as a preacher, starting professionally at the age of six,&nbsp;according to the&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Gospel Choice Awards.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWloZH15e5JpZrCgn2K2tHnRnq1mopGovaa%2BjLCgpaSZlrq0ecmrZJqqlam1onnFq5ino5yeu26x1KWmoLFdm8KvsdGao2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
