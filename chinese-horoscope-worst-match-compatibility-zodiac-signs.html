Zodiac</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who are the worst matches in Chinese astrology?</h2><p>Some <a href=#>signs</a> tend to not be very compatible with one another due to differing personality characteristics and worldly views.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Rat</h2><p>The Rat tends to be least compatible with the Horse or Rooster when it comes to the <a href=#>Chinese zodiac.</a></p><p>The Horse is considered as being independent, enthusiastic, and positive while the Rooster is smart, earnest, and confident.</p><p>Rats are unable to deal with the Horseâ€™s need for freedom or the Roosterâ€™s short-temper which can cause unnecessary fights and arguments.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/RAT-HORSE.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ox</h2><p>Meanwhile, the Ox is least<a href=#> compatible</a> with the Tiger, Dragon, Horse, and Goat.</p><p>Oxen like to be in charge of whatever they do, proving to be leaders with many opinions and much confidence.&nbsp;</p><p>If they pursued a relationship, friendship or romantic, with the Tiger, Dragon, or Horse they would clash due to similarities in their nature.</p><p>Yet, the Goatâ€™s submissiveness would prove to be problematic for the Ox.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/OX-GOAT.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Tiger</h2><p>The Tiger is the least <a href=#>compatible </a>with the Ox, Tiger, Snake, and Monkey.</p><p>Tigerâ€™s have a hard time finding common ground with the Ox and the Monkey.&nbsp;</p><p>The Snake can crave attention and the limelight which can pose as a threat for the Tigerâ€™s highly competitive nature.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MONKEY-TIGER.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Rabbit</h2><p>The Rabbit is least <a href=#>compatible</a> with the Snake and Rooster.</p><p>Rabbits are known for their modesty and adaptability to any circumstance.&nbsp;</p><p>If put with the Snake or Rooster, the Rabbit will grow impatient with arguing about the signâ€™s inability to compromise, their picky nature, and incessant complaints.&nbsp;</p><p>To prevent anxiety from looming over these relationships, it is best for a Rabbit to avoid the Snake or Rooster for long-term partnerships.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/RABBIT-ROOSTER.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Dragon</h2><p>The Dragon is least compatible with Ox, Goat, and Dog.&nbsp;</p><p>Mentally, both the Dragon and the Ox are headstrong and stubborn which make them unable to compromise.&nbsp;</p><p>The Goat and Dog can create a passive-aggressive environment for the Dragon and it can be the reason why fights will always occur in their union.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/DRAGON-DOG.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Snake</h2><p>The Snake is least compatible with the Tiger, Rabbit, Snake, Goat, and Pig.</p><p>Snakes have bold personalities and signs with similar characteristics may see them as competition for anything.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, there will be multiple misunderstandings which will contribute to instability and heated arguments.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/SNAKE-PIG.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Horse</h2><p>The Horse is least compatible with the Rat, Ox, Rooster, and another Horse.</p><p>Both the Rat and the Horse can have terrible tempers so it is not best for partnerships of any kind.&nbsp;</p><p>The Ox and the Rooster are very different from the Horse and will have a hard time agreeing.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Goat</h2><p>The Goat is least compatible with the Ox, Tiger, and Dog.&nbsp;</p><p>Goats will argue with these signs due to their hot-headed nature.&nbsp;</p><p>They will consistently engage in quarrel with no clear objective in sight which is why pursuing a relationship with either sign is not recommended.</p><p>Anything that seems wrong to these signs will create explosive fights with no room for agreement or compromise.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/NINTCHDBPICT000614526411-1.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Monkey</h2><p>The Monkey is least compatible with the Tiger and Pig.&nbsp;</p><p>The Tiger is too focused on itself to care about the Monkeyâ€™s needs, which can sometimes come off as selfish and rude to the Monkey.&nbsp;</p><p>The Pig struggles to communicate properly with the Monkey and that can create misunderstandings.</p><p>These signs uphold different values and will not see eye-to-eye.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/NINTCHDBPICT000614526465.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Rooster</h2><p>The Rooster is least compatible with the Rat, Rabbit, Horse, and Dog.&nbsp;</p><p>When partnered, these signs can be brutal with their opinions and criticism of each other.</p><p>The Rooster is proud of being ambitious and a self starter and can leave those jealous or anxious about Roosterâ€™s nature.&nbsp;</p><p>They can also appear to be self-indulgent which can cause rifts in these relationships.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/NINTCHDBPICT000614526442.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Dog</h2><p>The Dog is least compatible with the Dragon, Goat, Rooster, and other <a href=#>Dogs</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>These signs will not understand one another, especially with the Goat who can be meek and docile.&nbsp;</p><p>While the Dog is loyal, they are also quick to their feet and very courageous, and can cause jealousy among the other signs.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/NINTCHDBPICT000614526466.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Pig</h2><p>The Pig is least compatible with the Snake, Monkey, and Rooster.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/NINTCHDBPICT000614526480.jpg><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Horoscopes</h2></p><h2

src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/CHINESE-ZODIAC-SIGN-TOGETHER-07.jpg><p>A relationship with these signs will raise suspicion and instability.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>The aggravating nature of the Snake, Monkey, and Rooster will create anxiety in the partnership because the Pig can be slow-witted and very good tempered.</p><p>It is important to note that these incompatibilities not only apply to love but also to friendships and other unions.</p><img
