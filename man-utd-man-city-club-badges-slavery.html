The campaign was denounced as “woke nonsense” yesterday."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Labour MP Graham Stringer said the “crazy” claim tarnished the northern city’s proud history of anti-discrimination.</p><p>He added: “Manchester had nothing to do with the slave trade.</p><p><h2

the craziest campaigns I have ever seen.”</p><p>Guardian commentator Simon Hattenstone yesterday questioned whether the ship was a symbol of a “crime against humanity”.</p><p>He said the area’s cotton mills thrived as a result of the crop picked by US slaves.</p><p>The newspaper has recently apologised for what it considers to be its own links to the slave trade.</p><p>He wrote: “The ship has nothing to do with football and everything to do with the business from which Manchester made its <a href=#>money</a>.</p><p>“The product of slavery became so ­subtly embedded in our culture that we celebrated it in our club badges even without realising it.”</p><p>However local experts said ­<a href=#>Lancashire</a> mill workers at the time refused on principle to deal with cotton picked by slaves.</p><p>United historian JP O’Neill, who authored Red Rebels: United and the FC Revolution, said of Hattenstone: “His ‘logic’ is as ridiculous as it is contradictory.</p><p>“Not only did the club badges long post-date the abolition of slavery, the clubs themselves were only founded decades after slavery was ended.</p><p>“The first ship to arrive in Manchester came in 1894 with the opening of the Ship Canal.</p><p>“In Manchester, cotton workers during the <a href=#>American Civil War</a> refused to work with slave-picked cotton, ­putting their livelihoods at risk.”</p><p>Tory MP Katherine Fletcher, who is from Wythenshawe and a United season-ticket holder, added: “I’ve always seen the ship logo as a symbol of our industrial trading heritage.</p><p>“Manchester people are some of the most even-handed and welcoming in the world.”</p><p>Historian Jonathan Schofield added: “It’s a symbol of free trade.</p><p>“The idea is we will have equality throughout the world because ­people will have the same rights to do business with each other.”</p><p>It is claimed the ships derive from Manchester’s coat of arms, adopted in 1842.</p><p>That was 35 years after the slave trade had been outlawed in the British Empire.</p><p>Manchester City was not established in its current form until 1894 while United switched from Newton Heath in 1902.</p><p>Fans at the stadiums yesterday advised campaigners to steer clear of their club’s badges.</p><p>Pilot Mike Goldstein, 57, who has been going to City games since he was eight, said: “It’s just woke nonsense.</p><p>"You can’t keep on going back.</p><p>“It’d be like being mad at the Italians for the <a href=#>Roman Empire</a>.”</p><p>Sitting on a bench outside <a href=#>Old Trafford</a>, Man United fan Peter Shaw, 34, said: “It’s ridiculous to remove it.</p><p>“It’s celebrating the Ship Canal and nothing to do with the slave trade.”</p><p>Pallet fitter Joe Burazin, 21, added: “It’s part of the club’s heritage.</p><p>“These people should keep their hands off.”</p><p>Chef and United fan Jamie Parkhouse, 37, said: “People are rightly asking questions about the slave trade but this shouldn’t be one of them.</p><p>“The badge is about the <a href=#>Manchester</a> Ship Canal and not slaves.</p><p>“To link the badge and the slave trade is so over-the-top.”</p><p>Fans also vented online.</p><p>One tweeted: “It’s a picture of a ship not a ‘slave’ ship.</p><p>“Why do you lot continually try and find offence when none is there? Pathetic.”</p><p>James Delaney added: “So not really a symbol of slavery at all.</p><p>“More like a symbol of early global commerce and Britain’s dominance of it.”</p><p>A branding expert warned modifying the badges would cost millions.</p><p>It comes after other sports teams including the <a href=#>NFL</a>’s <a href=#>Washington Redskins</a> have <a href=#>changed their name</a> after criticism from indigenous groups.</p><p>Nigel Currie said: “It would be a huge and expensive operation to change the United and City club crests.</p><p>“They have been around for decades and every replica shirt ever sold has them — literally millions of shirts which can’t be changed.</p><p>“The link with slavery is not nearly as strong or as clear as other potentially damaging historical links for sports teams.</p><p>“The cost to the clubs would be extremely high and the rationale for changing doesn’t sound strong and indeed there is debate over what the actual ships represent.</p><p>“While that debate remains, a change would seem unlikely.”</p><p>Last month The Guardian revealed that its founder <a href=#>John Edward Taylor</a> was partners with companies which im­ported cotton picked by slaves.</p><p>At least nine of his 11 financial backers also had links to slavery.</p><p>Last night, Luthfur ­Rahman, the deputy leader of Manchester City Council, said: “We’re an industrious, international, multicultural city and have long been so.”</p><p>Work is under way to explore its past.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>He added: “We’re in the ­middle of a long-term project that began in 2020 to highlight and reflect on aspects of the city’s past, including the city’s black history and connections to the slave trade.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/manchester-united-badge-232356065.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/manchester-city-badge-254478738.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/mike-goldstein-56yrs-outside-old-811156217.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZH9zfJhucG5xX6Kur3nUrZtmpZGjeqS107JknKSll3qjrcOgnKxlo6Gut7HRsmY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
