At just the age of six months, his family moved to Compton and later again settled in Santa Barbara.</p><p>After completing his primary education at Santa Barbara High School, he enrolled at Santa Barbara City College. Later, he transferred to New Mexico State University.</p><p>Just like his son, Randi also had a love for sports, especially baseball and football. Throughout Ventura Country, he used to train young boys.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Darius-Vines-Late-Father-Randi-Vines.jpg><p>Discussing Darius’ parents’ relationship, his father met his mother and began dating in 1998.

He was my hero. He would always tell me, ‘This is our thing. Trust me: When you get there, you’re gonna do well.”</p><p>After the match, he also revealed that he was feeling his late father’s energy during his performance, which encouraged him to deliver a remarkable performance on his MLB debut.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Even though Darius was sad that his father wasn’t there, his mother and grandmother were with him at the Coors Field stadium when he made his MLB debut.</p><p>His supportive family witnessed his success in his MLB debut against the Rockies.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunCwwKugrqtdq7avsdJmp5qqlaPBtHnAp56epJFisLC7z56pZpmemXqzrc2doGaumaOytHs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
