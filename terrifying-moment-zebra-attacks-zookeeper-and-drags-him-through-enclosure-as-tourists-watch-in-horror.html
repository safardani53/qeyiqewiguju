The dramatic incident took place at the Chimelong Safari Park in Guangzhou, capital of South China’s Guangdong Province - and the viral video comes just days aftera male tourist was mauled to death by a tiger in an East China zoo.
In the 15-second clip, which has since been viewed tens of millions of times on China’s popular microblogging site Sina Weibo, tourists can be heard gasping as the zebra clamps its teeth into the zoo employee’s arm."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

They become violent if they believe a predator is threatening the herd and will fight to protect the young. The unpredictable animals are not domesticated and can panic if they feel they are in danger. Stallions can also become violent during mating. The stallions fight each other over mares and mares fight to mate with the stallion.</p><br><p>Yesterday it was reported that grieving&nbsp;relatives of the&nbsp;dad-of-two mauled to death by three tigers have <a href=#>blasted the lax security that allowed him climb into the enclosure</a>.</p><p>They reportedly claim zoo management should shoulder the blame for gaps in supervision of the fences which may have tempted the man to skip paying by&nbsp;hopping over.</p><p>The pair were pictured on top of the barrier just moments before the attack.</p><p><strong>We pay for your stories!
