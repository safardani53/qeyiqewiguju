In 1977, Daisy Jones & The Six were on top of the world. Fronted by two charismatic lead singers — Daisy Jones and Billy Dunne — the band had risen from obscurity to fame.

She was definitely inspirational to me," she added.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In February 2023, Keough spoke to PEOPLE again at the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Los Angeles premiere of Daisy Jones & The Six</a>. The actress discussed what it was like to play a singer, knowing so many see her as Elvis' living legacy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I mean, it was amazing because I'm passionate about music and we had rehearsed for a year and a half," Keough said. "By the time we got to the stage, it was very exciting and we were all just like thrilled to be able to test out the thing we'd been practicing for so long."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Regarding rehearsals, it seems Keough had to do some extra work for the role because, as she admitted on Feb. 27, 2023, she <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>lied about her singing experience</a> during her audition.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I think I blacked out on that meeting. I don't really remember what happened," Keough said at a screening of the Prime Video series in New York City. "And then I auditioned like everybody else, and lied to them and told them l could sing."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Still, it seems she was right for the role. "In truth, I couldn't have asked for a better teammate," Claflin said of Keough. "As much as she had that reputation in her family genes, she didn't come with much musical experience herself, so the two of us had each other to lean on in that way."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-is-there-a-trailer-for-daisy-jones--the-six></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Is there a trailer for Daisy Jones & The Six</strong><strong>?</strong></span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Amazon Prime Video released the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>first official trailer</a> for the film in January 2023. The minute-and-a-half clip opens with the sounds of a chanting crowd and shows Daisy Jones making her way on stage. Meanwhile, two intriguing statements flashed across the screen: "Their music made them famous. Their breakup made them legends."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Viewers then hear Daisy Jones and Billy Dunne belting a duet before watching the pair have a heartfelt discussion about the content of their music.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"You write songs about who you wish you were, not who you are," Keough's character tells Claflin's character. "What if you wrote songs about the guy who wants things that he shouldn't?" To which Billy Dunne responds, "Who'd want to hear a song about that?"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Prior to the trailer's release, Amazon shared a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>short teaser</a> on Dec. 6, 2022, which showed Keough and Claflin suited up as their rockstar characters for the first time.

"There's an opportunity to subvert and create a guitar personality that could have been present in the Seventies, and wasn't."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The actors had their work cut out for them as well as some of them had no prior music experience.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I have to say, I'd never picked up a guitar before I got this part," Claflin told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Vanity Fair</a> of his experience becoming Billy Dunne. "And, you know, having read the book, it wasn't overly clear that I was due to be playing because we took some creative freedom and slightly shifted the parts a little bit, meaning that I was going to be playing not lead guitar, thank God, but rhythm guitar. I had to learn how to hold the guitar, how to strum a guitar. I had the biggest journey to go with the singing as well."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While Keough may be the granddaughter of the King of Rock 'N' Roll, channeling Daisy Jones was no easy feat either.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I didn't even know how one gets to be able to sing loud. I went to a vocal coach and I was like, 'They need me to belt.' I sounded so bad that I started crying," she said. "I was like, 'I have to do it.' I'm gonna go to this vocal coach, and he's gonna teach me how to f------ belt, whatever I need to do to get this. It really became about pushing myself to do things I've never done before."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-70 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In March 2023, Chacon, who plays Warren Rojas, spoke to PEOPLE about <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>the possibility of a real-life tour</a>, explaining that they've "been throwing around a lot of different ideas for public appearances, maybe, for some moment."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-72 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"A tour is not out of the question," he added.
