Surely a few glasses of water wouldn’t compare to my £46 tub of Clinique moisturiser?</p><p>It took me until 3pm to finish my first litre and the rest of the day was then spent between my desk, frantically guzzling from my bottle and the toilet - which I visited 12 times that day!</p><p>Slumped in bed feeling sick, bloated and uncomfortable, I realised I’d been naïve to the difficulty of my challenge.</p><p>Integrating this much water into my daily routine was going to be tricky.<br></p><h2>Day 2</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000425495095.jpg><p>I neither looked nor felt any different waking up the next day. I reluctantly filled my bottle at 7am, determined not to repeat yesterday’s mistake. And my mood didn’t improve when nature called whilst out on a lengthy dog walk. Surrounded by shrubbery and not a toilet in sight, my options were limited.</p><p>Evening came and I wasn’t surprised that I’d seen no obvious change at this early stage. But my constant need for the loo was really getting in the way of daily life. Surely I couldn’t survive the week like this?<br></p><h2>Day 3</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000425495091-e1533741360255.jpg><p>Satisfied from a great night’s sleep and suddenly noticing a surprising softness to my skin, the previous days’ woes were quickly forgotten. Although I couldn’t physically see any changes, my skin felt smoother and it seemed to be absorbing my moisturiser much better.</p><p>Having not eaten much that day, I was taken aback by my sudden burst of energy at the gym. With more stamina and fewer food cravings, I was finally starting to see some small but significant benefits.<br></p><h2>Day 4</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000425495088-e1533741414827.jpg><p>I was relieved that my body had finally adjusted to my new routine; the bloating subsided and I was no longer running to a toilet every two minutes – HOORAY!</p><p>Having indulged in a few glasses of wine the night before, I was anticipating the familiar, post-alcohol headache. But feeling fully hydrated, the sore head never came – why had I never tried this before?! I’d expected better skin, but it hadn’t dawned on me that water was also an unbeatable hangover cure!</p><p>Watching my friends suffer on their sofas only made me more smug.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">How much water should I drink a day?</h3></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-mce-href=http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Goodfood/Pages/water-drinks.aspx>The NHS advise</a>&nbsp;drinking six to eight glasses of fluids per day.</p><p>Roughly speaking, this is about three or four 500ml bottles of water.</p><p>And it's not a good idea to over-do it, because&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-mce-href=https://www.thesun.co.uk/living/2524309/woman-suffers-life-threatening-fits-after-accidentally-overdosing-on-herbal-remedies-and-water/>this can impact negatively on your health</a>&nbsp;too.</p><p>Water&nbsp;isn't the only drink which counts.

The dark and indented bags under my eyes looked lighter and less heavy. And despite the early start to my morning, my eyes themselves looked brighter.</p><p>Greeted with some rare British sunshine and having sweated out much of the liquid I’d put into my body, I surprised myself by exceeding my three litre target (I drank 3.5 litres). I felt much thirstier than usual and regular sips of water were becoming a necessity.<br></p><h2>Day 6</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000425495092.jpg><p>With the week drawing to a close, I was in a positive mind-set with clearer skin and a clearer head.

The results were beyond anything I’d expected.</p><p>The biggest change was in my skin. My face was no longer dry and blotchy, it felt hydrated, smooth and the dull bags under my eyes had faded.</p><p>I’d lost a tiny bit of weight (0.4kg), but as I’m firmly within the healthy range on the BMI scale, my weight loss expectations were low.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">The Fabulous Beauty Awards 2019</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/as-comp-beauty-awards-1.jpg><p class=article__content--intro>Win a dream holiday to Jamaica worth over £4,000 by voting in our Fabulous Beauty Awards</p><p>All you have to do to be in with a chance of winning this trip, worth over £4,000, is to vote for your fave products.
