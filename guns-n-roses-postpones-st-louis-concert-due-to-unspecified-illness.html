Great Venue!! N’ great to be back!!” he wrote alongside a picture of a mini horse via <a href=#>X</a> (<a href=#>formerly known as Twitter</a>) on Saturday, September 2. “Again my apologies and thank you!!”</p><p>Guns N’ Roses <a href=#>kicked off their 2023 tour</a> in June in Tel Aviv, Israel. They played nearly 20 shows across Spain, Belgium, Denmark, Norway, The U.K., Germany, Switzerland, Italy, the Netherlands, France, Romania, Hungary and Greece before beginning the North American leg of the tour in Canada last month.</p><p>While the new St. Louis concert date has yet to be announced, the band is expected to play the Thompson-Boling Arena in Knoxville, Tennessee, before rounding out the tour with shows in Florida, Mississippi, Texas, California, Arizona and British Columbia.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The group has an interesting history with St. Louis, as they previously canceled a gig in 2016 on the 25th anniversary of the Riverport Riot. During a 1991 performance in St. Louis, chaos broke out after Rose dove into the crowd after yelling at a fan for taking pictures. Rose and the band ended the show early, promoting an hours-long riot from fans. They made their official return to St. Louis in 2017.</p><p>The band is the latest of several celebrities who have postponed upcoming shows due to illness. <a href=#><strong>Bruce Springsteen</strong></a> postponed <a href=#>his September tour dates</a> after revealing he’s been suffering from peptic ulcer disorder while <a href=#>Paramore</a> also <a href=#>canceled their remaining tour dates</a> due to lead singer <a href=#><strong>Hayley Williams</strong></a>’ ongoing lung infection.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJ6upqNiu26%2BzqycrGWgpMC1vM6nnKxlo6l6rbvUoqpmm5%2BjsKa%2B02abrp1dqbxuwc2sp56bmZu2prCMoqOlppWowHA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
