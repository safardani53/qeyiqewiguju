Overfishing and a return in tourist numbers after two years of the Covid pandemic could see sharks entering waters ever closer to humans in several holiday hotspots.
Although mercifully rare, shark attacks can happen in the Mediterranean and some Brit holiday hotspots It comes after the world's fastest shark, a 15-foot beast, was spotted off the coast of Spain."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It's not a good idea to be bleeding in the water, but having bleeding fish - and particularly struggling wounded fish - is going to be more of an attractant, such as spearfishing.</p><p>"Other things you can do is avoid the waters after heavy storms, avoid swimming at dawn or dusk, and avoid swimming close to river mouths.</p><p>"Be observant. Most of the waters in the popular beaches are very clear so if there is an approaching shark, someone will see it.</p><p>"When you swim, swim with at least one other person - that's a good idea for general safety."</p><p>Plotting precise shark numbers in the Med is notoriously tricky, with maps of shark sightings and attacks just one way of building up a picture.</p><p>As Alessandro put it: "Generally sharks, like most wild animals, prefer to keep their distance from humans.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The Sun">Read More on The Sun</h2><p>"Most divers who regularly dive in Mediterranean waters have never encountered a single shark.</p><p>"Therefore each encounter with a shark in the area should be considered a positive event, not something to be feared."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZoZ0gpFubG5no52us7eMmqutmZOgeq6xw6Krnqqilruqrc1mqqmZmaN6prPYqatmoJ%2BhtqWt2Gg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
