Many bookmakers offer a wide range of betting markets. Here are some of the most common markets you’ll find:</p><ul><li><strong>Outright tournament winner bet</strong> - This one is self-explanatory. Essentially, you’ll have to predict which players will win a certain competition.</li><li><strong>Match win bet</strong> - With this bet, you’re only wagering on the winner of a specific match. This is one of the most common bets in darts.</li><li><strong>Set win bet</strong>&nbsp;- Darts bookmakers also allow you to bet on specific sets. The final match result doesn’t count towards this bet.</li><li><strong>Nine-darter bet</strong>&nbsp;- In simple terms, a nine-darter is a perfect game. If you place this bet, your selected player has to score 501 points with exactly nine darts.</li><li><strong>Most 180s</strong>&nbsp;- The maximum points you can hit with three darts is 180. To win this bet, you’ll have to guess which of the opposing players gets the most 180s during the match.</li><li><strong>Correct score</strong> - To win a Correct Score bet, you’ll have to correctly predict how many sets each player will win.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Handicap betting</strong>&nbsp;- Handicap bets give one player an advantage or a disadvantage. To win your bet, your chosen player must overcome the disadvantage or stay within the advantage.</li><li><strong>King of the Oche</strong> - King of the Oche combines several bets into one – Match Winner, Most 180s, and the Highest Checkout. The latter requires having the highest-value final dart.</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What offers are popular for betting on darts?</h2><p>If you enjoy betting with a bonus, we have great news.
