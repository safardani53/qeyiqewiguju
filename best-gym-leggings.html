There are different types of leggings depending on how you're exercising. For example, if you're an outdoors runner, you'll want material that repels sweat while also keeping you warm, but if you prefer doing weight training then the leggings can be a softer material.
Just like any jeans or trousers, leggings can be high-waisted, mid-rise or low-rise and which you opt for depends on your preference, however most seem to sit somewhere between high and super high waisted."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Plus, the wide 'MP' monogram waistband really does pull you in in the right places.</p><p>As a UK size 10-12, we tried out medium and the fit was perfect, giving us a flattering silhouette that made us want to wear these post-workout too.</p><p>When you're exercising, they wick away moisture well without feeling damp and the tight high-waist makes you feel significantly supported, ensuring that the leggings don't budge for a second as you jump, squat and stretch.</p><p>In terms of comfort and flexibility, these can't be faulted, but our only critique would be the shading shape around your butt – we opted for longer tees when wearing these in public for that reason.</p><h2>10. Lululemon <strong>Wunder Train HR Tight 25"</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/LW5CXNS_048675_1-e1629887577550.jpeg><ul><li><strong>Wunder Train HR Tight 25", £88 from Lululemon - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>Designed for training, the Wunder Train HR Tights from Lululemon are cut from Everlux™ fabric which wicks away moisture as you work out and has a flexible, four-way stretch.</p><p>We love the Dispersed Light Raw Linen Multi colour way, but you can choose from 14 other shades and prints if it doesn't take your fancy.</p><p>Just like everything by Lululemon, the leggings are silky soft, made from a fabric that's cool to touch and makes you feel like you're not wearing anything at all.</p><p>The waistband is thick and rises up over your belly button, giving you a fit that feels really secure and supportive – our only fault is that they're not that long with more of a 7/8 length for us (we're tall).</p><p>However, they're definitely perfect for a comfortable workout, doubling as stylish loungewear for those days off too.</p><p>We can see why people splash out on Lululemon.</p><h2>11. MP Women's Shape Seamless Ultra Leggings</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/12645138-1404831608283761-e1629885229534.jpg><ul><li><strong>MP Women's Shape Seamless Ultra Leggings - Deep Sea Blue, £21.99 from MyProtein - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>If you want something skin-tight, MyPotein's Shape Seamless Ultra Leggings might be your next sportswear staple.</p><p>Available for less than £22, this high-waisted, contouring style are designed to be as close-fit as hoisery yet absorb sweat with quick-drying fabric.</p><p>When putting these on, be prepared to pull, but don't size up just because they're tight. We ordered a medium and when we tried to put them on, immediately regretted our decision BUT&nbsp;we persisted and once we got them on and pulled up the high-waist, they fitted like a glove.</p><p>The stretch fabric really does contour your hips and butt, giving you support that feels like you're not wearing anything at all – these are a steal for £21.99 as they replicate a lot more expensive leggings on the market.</p><p>As the waistband is thick, you feel secure throughout your workout, whether you're running or squat-jumping. Just make sure that you pull them up well and ensure they're on properly before you start your session.</p><p>Now to resist buying them in every colour...</p><h2>12. Under Armour <strong>Women's UA HydraFuse Leggings</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/V5ProdWithBadge.jpeg><ul><li><strong>Women's UA HydraFuse Leggings, £75 from Under Armour - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>The UA HydraFuse Leggings by Under Armour are described on-site as "next-to-skin without the squeeze".</p><p>At £75, the four-way stretch fabric is embedded with microspheres which activate on contact and help rehydrate dry skin – now, that's fancy.</p><p>And wow. These leggings sure are soft. We'd go as far as to say that these are the softest leggings we have ever worn.</p><p>As they're so velvety-smooth, they're ridiculously snug and allow you to work out without feeling restricted as they're also extremely stretchy.</p><p>Aside from the fabric, the seamless pockets are also really deep, ideal for stashing your keys when you're out for a run, or your AirPod case and phone whilst you exercise.</p><p>They fit true-to-size – we're a size 12 and opted for large but they were a bit too big so next time we'd go for medium.</p><h2>13. Pour Moi <strong>Energy 7/8 Metallic Print Legging</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/247607_20210415115800-e1629885264444.jpg><ul><li><strong>Energy 7/8 Metallic Print Legging - Black/Rose Gold, £34 from Pour Moi - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>As modelled by TOWIE's Jess Wright above, Pour Moi's Energy 7/8 Metallic Print Leggings are for someone who wants to add a funky edge to their gym-drobe.</p><p>Featuring a rose gold sparkle print, they're ankle-grazing length with a high waist and small zip pocket at the back.</p><p>As we usually opt for more minimal styles, we were out of our comfort zone a bit in these, but if you are looking for a loud and glamorous style, then they just might be the leggings for you.</p><p>They're definitely high quality leggings for just £34, made from a stretchy fabric that's really smooth all over and fits your figure like a glove.</p><p>The sizing is spot on too and the extra high waist securely ensures that they don't budge when you're working out, whether you're practising yoga or putting yourself through a HIIT session.</p><p>If you're feeling really wacky, you can match them with the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">sports bra </a>– you'll definitely turn heads at your next gym class.</p><h2>14. TALA Zinnia Leggings</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/halfzipcrop_Black_8_2_1800x1800-e1629886477421.jpg><ul><li><strong>Zinnia legging, £40 from TALA - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>If sustainability is what you look for in your activewear then TALA could be your new fave shopping destination.</p><p>They design and make their sportswear (and casualwear) from recycled plastic bottles and factory off-cuts, whilst promoting body positivity with flattering fits. Yay.</p><p>We tried out a pair of black Zinnia leggings, and immediately noticed how thick and opaque the fabric was. No VPLs here.</p><p>Normally a size 12-14, we tried them out in a size Medium and it's worth mentioning that they were a little on the snug side.</p><p>We didn't mind this too much as it meant that they didn't budge when we were sprinting around in them, but if you're between sizes or prefer a roomier fit, then we'd suggest going a size up.</p><p>Overall, we found them to be really comfortable, pretty flattering and forgot we were wearing them whilst working out - which we'd say is a good sign.</p><p>Plus, it's always nice to feel like you're helping the environment out by shopping sustainably.</p><h2><strong>What are gym leggings made of?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Your gym leggings can be made of different fabrics.</p><p>The best one for you will depend on your personal preference and your favourite type of exercise.</p><p>The most popular leggings fabrics include cotton, polyester and nylon among others.</p><h3>Cotton gym leggings</h3><p>Cotton is usually a very soft and breathable fabric, making it suitable for those looking for something comfy to wear at the gym.</p><p>Bear in mind that it doesn't always hold up well to stretching and absorbs moisture, so it's better fitted to low-sweat workouts or gentler activities like yoga.</p><h3>Polyester gym leggings</h3><p>Polyester is known for its sweat-wicking properties making it ideal for those who love cardio. Less breathable than cotton, it can harbour smells so it needs to be washed on a regular basis.</p><h3>Nylon gym leggings</h3><p>Nylon is a lightweight material that dries very quickly meaning it can stand out to the sweatiest of workouts.</p><p>It does have a tendency to shrink, so make sure you wash it at the right temperature.</p><h2><strong>Why do my gym leggings ride down?</strong></h2><p>If your leggings are falling down, it might be due to a few things.</p><p>The simplest explanation is that you've picked the wrong size for you.</p><p>If your tights are loose and baggy around your crotch area, then try a size down or two. Excessive fabric in that area might cause chafing.</p><p>You can also try a higher waisted legging, which might be more appropriate to your body type.</p><p>Your leggings might also be sliding down because they are worn out and the elastic band is losing its elasticity.</p><p>Invest in a pair that ensures non-stretching in the wash and pick up detergent made for activewear to make your leggings last longer.</p><h2><strong>How to stop gym leggings falling down</strong></h2><p>Well, if your gym leggings are falling down then you haven't bought them in the correct size. The best gym leggings contour your figure in a skin-tight shape, tightly hugging your body without budging at all whilst you train.</p><p>That being said, if it's a common problem for you then you might want to try sizing down for an even tighter fit, and to always opt for high-waist styles with a thick band that is made to really cling to your waist.</p><p>All of the gym leggings on our list are cut from good quality fabrics which means they shouldn't really be falling down if you get yourself the correct size.</p><h2><span><strong>How tight should gym leggings be</strong>?</span></h2><p>Again this will largely depend on your favourite activity.</p><p>If you're a runner or you like high-intensity training, it's best to choose leggings that feel like a second skin.</p><p>This means they should feel comfortable but relatively tight around your calves and tights.</p><p>If you notice a bit of your belly spilling out over the waistband, it probably means your leggings are too tight and you should move a size up.</p><p>Those who practice yoga might opt for softer fabric - like cotton - which hugs the body without being too restrictive.</p><h2><strong>Should you wear knickers under gym leggings?</strong></h2><p>Some people actually go commando under their gym gear to avoid panty lines or chafing. But is that the right thing to do? Well, the answer is that it's entirely up to you.</p><p>If you choose not to wear knickers with your leggings, then you should make sure you opt for moisture-wicking fabrics, or even leggings woven with silver which acts as an antibacterial agent to avoid any infections.</p><p>However, be careful because if your leggings aren't thick enough, then you're risking contact with bacteria from the floor or seat, or wherever your butt ends up in your workout.</p><p>As soon as you finish your workout, you'll want to jump in the shower immediately, especially if you worked out without underwear on, as moisture can cause yeast infections.</p><p>But as we said, it's totally down to personal choice.</p><h2><strong>What pants to wear with gym leggings</strong></h2><p>Not convinced by the appeal of going commando? We have some top tips for what pants to wear with gym leggings.</p><p>First off, we definitely would recommend steering clear of thongs, unless they're specifically crafted to wick away moisture as you exercise &nbsp;– we say that because any friction can cause irritation, from bacterial infections to inflaming shaving rashes.</p><p>You should always be wearing breathable, stretchy and sweat-wicking pants, ones that basically make you feel like you're not wearing any.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MORE FROM SUN SELECTS FASHION</h2></p><br><p><strong>Get extra savings with <a href=# rel>The Sun Vouchers</a> including discounts and voucher codes for <a href=# rel>Under Armour</a> and similar Sports & Fitness voucher code brands.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqysp2Wjmrmmr9OsZnFpaG6Ddn2Om5ysrF2cxq55y56eoKGenMBw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
