“It sends Jane into a bit of a tizzy. These girls are not going to go down without a fight, and they’re going to fight for what they think is right,” Stevens, 27, says on the Thursday, January 23, episode of the “Watch With Us” podcast."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Season 4 of The Bold Type picks up immediately after the events of the finale: There are issues happening at Scarlet and Jaqueline (<strong>Melora Hardin</strong>) is no longer the Editor-in-Chief.

These girls are not going to go down without a fight, and they’re going to fight for what they think is right,” Stevens, 27, says on the Thursday, January 23, <a href=#>episode of the “Watch With Us” podcast</a>. “It might not be the most legal way of going about that. So you’ll see them get in that kind of mess.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Katie-Stevens-The-Bold-Type.jpg><p>During the finale, Jane also reconciled with Ryan (<strong>Dan Jeannotte</strong>), deciding to forgive him for kissing someone else — a decision Stevens found to be very empowering.</p><p>“I feel like we always see the kind of trophy story of somebody getting cheated on and then being like, ‘I’m done with you,’ and wiping their hands clean. Whereas, I think that a lot of decisions that happen are the decision to stay and that’s really difficult,” the Faking It alum says. “At the end of last season, Jane says, ‘If I broke up with you, it would be for the wrong reasons; it would be because I felt pressure that I had to.’ That’s pressure from outside forces. I think that we all want to act like we’re these like fully empowered people. But I think that there’s empowerment in choosing what’s right for you and not listening to the outside forces. So that’s the choice that Jane made — who knows if that was the right one for her. We’ll find out.”</p><p>There will also be new men entering Jane’s life the season — her family. Her father, played by <strong>Kelly AuCoin</strong>, as well as her brother, played by <a href=#><strong>Chord Overstreet</strong></a>, will appear in the later episodes of season 4. Oddly enough, Stevens is best friends with Overstreet’s sister — she was in her October wedding — so she already had a bond with the Glee alum.</p><p>“The week after my wedding was when we shot the episode with Chord and it was just so funny. It was nice because I kind of already have that banter with Chord,” she tells Us. Unfortunately, they won’t be singing — and even she’s not sure why.</p><p>“Maybe in the future when the writers and Freeform finally give us our musical episode, Chord can come back,” she says with a laugh, adding that they already have an idea for a campy musical episode, in which the three girls are on a mushroom trip and the entire thing is a hallucination. “That way, we can play into how ridiculous that is and how trippy and weird it is!</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>For more from Stevens, <a href=#>listen to the full episode above</a>. <a href=#>Subscribe for free</a> for more exclusive interviews and TV news.</p><p>The Bold Type premieres on Thursday, January 23, at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKuhnV2XvK2wjK2wqZ2jYriiwMieZKyslauyr7%2BMqKVmpJmbsm6vx5qloKGenHq0sdeyZKydkai8r3mTaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
