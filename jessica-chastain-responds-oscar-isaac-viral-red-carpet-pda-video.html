While at the premiere of their upcoming HBO miniseries Scenes From a Marriage at the Venice International Film Festival last week, a slow-mo video of Oscar, 42, caressing and kissing his co-star’s arms became a horny fixation on the internet. The actress, 44, addressed the moment on Wednesday, calling it “acting.”

“We’re acting, but also Oscar and I have been friends — we went to college together — so we’ve been friends more than half of our lives,” Jessica said on TODAY."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He made a joke out of it. All the photographers started laughing, and were like, ‘What just happened?'”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>The actress also joked that the internet’s fixation might be rooted in the lack of human interaction amid quarantine lockdown. “We have all been locked in our houses for so long. When this video went viral, I was like, people just need to see people touch and hold each other,” Jessica said. She also reminded viewers that the duo are happily married to other people.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Jessica-Chastain-Oscar-Isaac-pda-shutter-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>The actress has been married to fashion executive <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Gian Luca Passi de Preposulo</strong></a> since 2017, while Oscar has been married to screenwriter <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Elvira Lind</strong></a> since 2017, too. A few days after the viral red carpet moment, Jessica took to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Twitter with an apt response</a>: a photo of <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Morticia</strong> and <strong>Gomez Addams</strong></a> from The Addams family while promoting the release date of Scenes From a Marriage.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Based on a 1973 Swedish miniseries of the same name, the show will follow a crumbling marriage with Jessica and Oscar in the lead roles. If their viral red carpet video is any indication, the chemistry will probably be palpable.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH16e49xZqOdo6i2pK2MnJ%2Baq6SWtq950Z6qqaeemcBuu9KcmKtlmaiuoq%2BMr6CrmZxiv6awjJyYq6iVqXqxsMBmraKclaR8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
