I love helping people.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Health</h2></p><p>“We go into people's lives often at the best time of their life, when they are having a baby, or the worst, when they might be seriously unwell, injured or dying.&nbsp;</p><p>“We can make a real difference.</p><p>"Even the way you speak to a patient can make a difference, or the way you smile. People remember that.</p><p>“It’s always great to deliver a baby – although none have been named after me, yet!”</p><p>He remembers being called to a breech birth (where the bay is bottom or feet first) and to resuscitate a man who had a heart attack at the wheel while his <a href=#>pregnant</a> partner was in the passenger seat.</p><p>Mark said: "He was a young chap who went into cardiac arrest and crashed his car.&nbsp;</p><p>“It was very emotive as the partner, who was six months' pregnant, was standing at the roadside watching us resuscitate him.&nbsp;</p><p>“I got a letter afterwards to say he survived, which was incredible news.</p><p>“I’ve been woken in the middle of the night by a worried neighbour whose baby had had a bump to the head and she wasn’t sure what to do.</p><p>"To me it's a fantastic job and it's one I love doing. The simplest things can make a difference.&nbsp;</p><p>“The people in the NHS, who are there day in and day out, make it work."</p><p>Mark also volunteers for the <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">NHS GoodSAM app</a>, which means he could be called at a moment's notice to help those in need of medical help in his own time.&nbsp;</p><p>He also does school talks to educate children about the ambulance service.</p><p>Mark lives with wife Kathryn, 33, who is also a paramedic and the couple have two children, Caitlyn,11, and Isabelle, four.</p><p>Mark said: "Isabelle has a paramedic outfit and doctor’s kit.&nbsp;</p><p>“Whenever she sees a child who is upset or feeling unwell, she will always go up to them and try to make them feel better."</p><p>Tim Hickey, a paramedic who has worked with Mark, nominated him for our 999 Hero award along with Mark's wife, Kathryn.</p><p>Tim said: “Mark is an asset to the ambulance service and during his service has amassed vast knowledge and experience in emergency medicine.</p><p>“On top of that he is an all round top bloke and is brilliant at teaching younger colleagues in order to improve the service provided to our patients.”</p><h2>DR BENJAMIN MARRIAGE, CHRIS DOYLE AND KEVIN CUDDON&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/999-hero-category-dr-benjamin-843076588.jpg><p>WHEN <a href=#>Sarah de Lagarde </a>slipped getting off the tube and was dragged under the train, she thought she was going to die on the tracks.</p><p>The mum-of-two was hit by two trains – amputating her arm and leg – and lay bleeding out under the train for 15 minutes, calling for help.</p><p>Brave doctors and paramedics from the London Air Ambulance were able to pull her out and save her life on the platform, surrounded by commuters.</p><p>Sarah, 45, from Camden, north London, nominated Dr Benjamin Marriage and paramedics Chris Doyle and Kevin Cuddon from London's Air Ambulance Charity, who saved her life.</p><p>Sarah, an asset manager, said: “These men are true heroes. I was told I nearly died ten times. I am so lucky they were there.”</p><p>She was on her way home from work when the accident happened in September 2022.</p><p>Sarah said: “I was really tired. I remember closing my eyes for a second but I must have fallen asleep.&nbsp;</p><p>“I woke up disoriented and jumped off the train, but it wasn't my stop.</p><p>“I turned on my heel to try and board the train again but it was wet and I slipped.</p><p>"I fell against the carriage. I broke my nose and my front teeth. I fell down between the train and the platform and as the train departed, it crushed my limbs.</p><p>“I was on the tracks calling for help but a second train came in and crushed me again.”</p><p>Someone spotted Sarah and raised the alarm and a crew from London's Air Ambulance Charity was called.</p><p>Paramedic Kevin helped rescue Sarah from under the train and the team applied tourniquets on both limbs.&nbsp;</p><p>Sarah said: "That is what saved me or I would have bled out for sure. All this happened on the train platform.</p><p>“I remember saying: ‘Do you mind hurrying up as I'm going to die right here’.</p><p>“Dr Marriage was holding my hand and said: ‘You can't die right now, we have lots of people on the platform and they are all here to save you. Hold on a bit longer and we will get you out'.</p><p>“I remember his calming words as if it were yesterday."</p><p>Sarah was taken by London Air Ambulance emergency response car to the Royal London Hospital. Surgeons later amputated both her right arm and leg.</p><p>Kevin, 42, said: "Sarah was trapped in a very awkward position so I crawled under the train to help the London Fire Brigade get her out.</p><p>“We had to carry her about 30 metres under the train and put her on a device to lift her up to the platform.</p><p>"Her right foot had been amputated at the ankle and her right arm was separated from the shoulder.&nbsp;</p><p>“She was really quiet, pale and had lost a lot of blood.”</p><p>Sarah, whose children are 12 and eight, made it home from hospital in time to spend Christmas with her family.&nbsp;</p><p>She recently became the first person in the world to operate a new £250,000 AI bionic arm that can read her mind, after her husband Jeremy launched a GoFundMe to help pay for it.&nbsp;</p><p>Sarah, who also has a prosthetic leg, said: “The fact that I am here and alive and able to watch my children grow up is amazing.&nbsp;</p><p>“I owe these three incredible men my life."</p><h2>MICHELLE D’ARCY</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/999-hero-award-saving-life-833922113.jpg><p>WHEN off-duty lollipop lady Michelle D’Arcy went out for a quiet pub lunch with her husband, she didn’t think she would end up saving a life.</p><p>But when she heard a car had crashed outside the pub and the driver was unconscious, she sprang into action.</p><p>Michelle, who only had basic <a href=#>first aid training</a> as part of her job as a school crossing patrol warden, immediately ran to help Kay Rush, 63, who had suffered a <a href=#>cardiac arrest</a> at the wheel.</p><p>She gave Kay life-saving CPR inside Kay’s Seat Ibiza and restarted the flow of oxygen to her brain, saving her life.</p><p>She became the first in a chain of five people who performed CPR on Kay, including two police officers, meaning Kay has made a miraculous recovery.</p><p>Kay, who has nominated Michelle for the award, said: “If Michelle hadn’t been there that day, I definitely wouldn’t be here now, my brain would have been without oxygen for too long.</p><p>“I owe my life to her. I was driving to visit my mum, who is 92, so if I’d had the cardiac arrest five minutes later, she wouldn’t have been able to save me.</p><p>“It was fate that Michelle was there. She’s my guardian angel!”</p><p>Michelle, who works as a school crossing patrol at Lodge Farm Primary School, Stevenage, said: “I didn’t ever think I’d have to use my first aid training, but I couldn’t sit back and do nothing.</p><p>“Kay and I are friends for life now. I have always struggled with depression and a sense of purpose in life.</p><p>“Now I think that saving Kay is my purpose. She is so loved by her family, I feel so proud that I was able to keep them together.”</p><p>Michelle had been having lunch with her husband in the Mutual Friend pub in Stevenage, Herts, when Kay’s car crashed into parked cars outside.</p><p>Michelle said: “A barmaid went to see what had happened and came running back in shouting: ‘Can anyone do first aid?</p><p>“Nobody said anything, so I stood up. My husband said, ‘You can’t go, you’ve had a drink!’, but I said: ‘Nobody else is going!’ and I kicked off my sliders and ran.</p><p>“I think a couple of sips of beer gave me the Dutch courage I needed to help!</p><p>“I actually thought Kay had already died when I got to her, she was grey.</p><p>“But I remembered the first aid course I did, and they said to continue to give <a href=#>CPR</a> even if you think the patient has already passed, so I jumped into the passenger seat where I could get my weight behind me and started chest compressions.</p><p>“Suddenly she took a breath and I thought: ‘It’s working!”</p><p>When paramedics arrived to take over the CPR, Michelle’s husband had to help her, shaking, out of the vehicle.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>She says: “He bought me a double rum, I couldn’t believe what had happened.</p><p>“I’m just so grateful Kay is still with us and I was able to help.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqGcmqSknXxzf5VsaWlpaGS5sLjLoqeoqF2hrqXFjKmYq5mdmrGqr4ywpqaZnmK1qsCMramaoZ5ixKm7jJyYq52jYsSqutJo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
