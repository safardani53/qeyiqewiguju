When Swift was awarded the moon man for Best Female Video for "You Belong with Me" in 2009, West climbed the stairs to interrupt Swift's acceptance speech with the now-infamous proclamation, "Yo, Taylor, I'm really happy for you, I'ma let you finish, but Beyoncé had one of the best videos of all time!" Shortly after, a stunned Swift told reporters, "I was standing on stage and I was really excited because I'd just won the award and then I was really excited because <a href=# data-inlink=true data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Kanye West</a> was on stage … And then I wasn't excited anymore after that."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-september-14-2009-kanye-west-addresses-interrupting-taylor-swift-on-the-tonight-show-with-jay-leno></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>September 14, 2009: Kanye West addresses interrupting Taylor Swift on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I immediately knew in the situation that it was wrong and it was a spectacle," West said, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>also attributing the outburst</a> to a mixture of "sincerity and alcohol" on Ellen.

"My full-time job is your publicist," she told her then-husband. "I care what people think."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-75 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Kanye says what he wants and he has no filter … and some people may not understand that," Kardashian added during her interview.

"It definitely got her a lot of attention the first time," – referencing when West jumped on VMA stage – "I just don't think he should be punished for it still to this day."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-85 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I feel like I've had it with people blatantly treating my husband a certain way and making him look a certain way, and I'm gonna say how I feel," Kardashian said during her interview. "Kanye is always so honest and speaks his mind. And you know, when we were first dating, people would always talk s--- and he always had my back. At this point, I really don't give a f--- so I'll do whatever to protect my husband."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-87 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She then went on to add that Swift even helped West rewrite the lyrics within the song.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-89 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I'm so glad that you said the truth," Kourtney told her sister. "Yeah, I'm just speaking the truth," Kardashian replied.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-91 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At the end of the episode, Kardashian sat down with momager Kris Jenner to discuss the controversial interview and issues surrounded it. Jenner tried to play peacemaker, asking, "What would happen if you just called Taylor up and say 'What happened? How did this go so south?'

She offered new details about various "events that led up" to the call, adding that they were what caused her "to be pissed off when [West] called me a bitch."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-217 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She explained that she grew "really sick of the dynamic between he and I," adding that he reached out to reconnect in private on several occasions only to act differently in public, which she continued to look past "because all I ever wanted my whole career after that thing happened in 2009 was for him to respect me." She continued, "I hate that about myself … but that's where I was." She revealed they'd "go to dinner and stuff" and he "would say really nice things" about her music at the time, and she alleged that West even called her ahead of the 2015 VMAs to ask her to present the Video Vanguard Award to him as a public display of their reconciliation. "I was so stoked that he asked me that," Swift said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-219 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But when West got on stage and made a comment about MTV using his and Swift's interaction to boost ratings, "I realized he is so two-faced," she said. "That he wants to be nice to me behind the scenes, but then he wants to look cool, get up in front of everyone and talk s---."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-221 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">By the time "Famous" came out, Swift was done with the ups and downs of their drama.

I wanted you to put the song out," he tells the Grammy winner on the phone.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-228 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After telling Swift he included a "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>very controversial line</a>" about her in the song, the pop star nervously asks West what the lyrics are. A wary Swift asks if it's "gonna be mean," and West acknowledges even then-wife Kardashian initially felt it was "too crazy" but had come around. "It's like my wife's favorite f---ing line," he says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-230 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"So it says, 'To all my Southside n----- that know me best/ I feel like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Taylor Swift</a> might owe me sex," continues West with a chuckle.
