The daughter of Irish, Puerto Rican and Jamaican parents, Tori was exposed to a variety of music while growing up. She pursued singing as a child, appearing on the re-launched version of Star Search in 2004 when she was only 12. Though she didn’t win, she would later appear on America’s Most Talented Kids, winning by singing <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Christina Aguilera</strong></a>’s “Keep on Singin’ My Song.” In 2007, at the age of 14, Tori began to upload videos of her performing hits onto YouTube. She gained an online following, which encouraged her to try out on Season 9 on American Idol. Though she didn’t make it to the “Top 24,” the elimination motivated her to write more songs. In 2012, she released her first EP, Handmade Songs by Tori Kelly. Recorded in her bedroom, it made the Top 10 Pop Albums. In 2013, she released her single, “Fill A Heart” which was covered by <strong>The Wanted</strong> on Dancing With The Stars. The success of the song led her to tour and perform across the country. Later that year, she announced her major label debut with her second EP, Forward. She singed with manager, <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Scooter Braun</strong></a>, to further her career. She is set to release her debut album in 2015.</p><p id=content-paragraph-2><span class=celeb_profile_label>Best Known For</span><br>Tori is best known as a singer, a songwriter, and a YouTube star.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3><span class=celeb_profile_label>Personal Life:&nbsp;</span><br>Tori’s cover of <strong>Frank Ocean</strong>’s “Thinkin’ Bout You” ranked over 22 million views.
