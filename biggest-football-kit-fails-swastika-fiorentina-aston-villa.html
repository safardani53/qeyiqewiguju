Every year, the world's leading clubs will change up their shirts for a different design.
We've seen some incredible kits over the years that have become collector's items.
But, we've also had some absolute stinkers that have had bigger problems than just their design.
And they have become iconic for all the wrong reasons.
SunSport looks at the biggest kits fails, starting with a Premier League and a fabric issue."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

handle the sweaty athletes that wear them.</p><p><a href=#>Aston Villa's 2023-2024 jersey</a> did none of that, and was a huge disaster for the English giants.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

action against Legia Warsaw.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Football</h2></p><p>Fans online said it looked the players had taken a shower in them.</p><p>It could also have explained why they lost 3-2 in Poland.</p><p>Worse still, reports said that <a href=#>Villa's women's team dreaded wearing it.</a></p><h2>Fiorentina 1992-1993</h2><p>The Serie A giants were caught in a race row in the early 90s with an away strip <a href=#>Gabriel Batistuta</a> and Co had to wear.</p><p>Sponsored by 7 Up, that bit looked retro and cool.</p><p>But a closer inspection of the pattern on the shoulders and arms revealed a hidden design that looked like a swastika.</p><p>Unfounded rumours claimed the club, who were famous for the fascist allegiances during World War II, purposefully included the Nazi symbol onto the fabric.</p><p>Fiorentina soon pulled the shirt and said in a statement: "Fiorentina and the manufacturers, Lotto, would like to underline that the optical [swastika] effect is purely a matter of chance."</p><p>To add insult to injury, the club were relegated that season.</p><img

kit is a bit lame.</p><p>But that's exactly what Man Utd boss <a href=#>Sir Alex Ferguson</a> did when his side wore their infamous grey shirt in 1996</p><p>Fergie claimed the shirt blended into the crowd and his players couldn't pick their passes out.</p><p>3-1 down at half-time, they were ordered to change their shirts.</p><p>Worth noting the score finished 6-3, so they lost the second half too.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

and cost <a href=#>The Terriers</a> a fine for misconduct.</p><p>The drama unfolded before a preseason friendly against Rochdale, when Town marched out with a shirt that had a HUGE Paddy Power sponsorship banner across the jersey.</p><p>Looking more like beauty pageant contestants than a football team, it infringed on the FA's sponsorship rules that read, &nbsp;'one single area not exceeding 250 square centimetres on the front of the shirt'.</p><p>The FA banned the shirts, so it is unclear if it was something that would have continued for the rest of the season, or was just a joke for that game.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

tradition.</p><p>Barcelona fans had got used to icons like <a href=#>Diego Maradona</a>, <a href=#>Johan Cruyff</a> and <a href=#>Lionel Messi</a> wearing the famous vertical red and blue stripes.</p><p>But there was uproar when the stripes were changed to horizontal for the 2015-2016 season.</p><p>A poll in a Spanish newspaper revealed that 78 per cent of Barcelona fans hated the shirts.</p><p>The experiment lasted just one season, before <a href=#>Barcelona</a> reverted back to their famous design.</p><p>Interestingly, the Catalans also tried a break from the norm with a checked pattern that didn't catch on.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

a onesie in the knockout stages created by Puma.</p><p>Fecafoot, the country's football federation, was fined £125,000 and they were docked six qualifying points from their World Cup
