While posing for pics with her costars, Pugh was hit in the face by an object thrown from the crowd, per <a href=# rel=noopener>social media footage</a>.</p><p>The incident prompted shocked reactions from Pugh’s castmates, who checked to see whether she was OK. Pugh appeared to mouth the word, “Ow,” before proceeding to bend over to pick up the object.</p><p>Pugh’s Don’t Worry Darling costar <strong>Harry Styles</strong> went through a similar situation earlier this year. During a July concert in Vienna, Austria, the 29-year-old singer was <a href=# rel=noopener>hit by an item</a> thrown by an attendee. After pausing for a moment, he proceeded to walk upstage while covering his eye.</p><p><strong>Kelsea Ballerini</strong>, for her part, left the stage completely after a fan <a href=#>threw a bracelet</a> at her face during a June concert in Boise, Idaho.</p><p>“Hi. I’m fine,” the country star, 30, wrote via her Instagram Story after the show. “Someone threw a bracelet, it hit me in the eye, and it more so just scared me than hurt me. We all have triggers and layers of fears way deeper than what is shown, and that’s why I walked offstage to calm down and make sure myself, band and crew, and the crowd all felt safe to continue.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Florence-Pugh-Hit-By-Object-Thrown-During-Dune-Part-Two-CCXP-Panel-in-Brazil.jpg><p>She added: “That’s all I ever want, is for shows to feel like a safe place for us all. I love you and appreciate all of the concern, let’s make the last two shows of the Heartfirst tour the best yet.”</p><p>At Sunday’s event, Pugh appeared to be in good spirits despite the incident, matching Zendaya, also 27, at the fan convention by sporting a white cutout dress featuring spaghetti straps and two skirt slits. The first ten minutes of Dune: Part Two were shown during the panel, including a first look at Pugh as Princess Irulan.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Florence-Pugh-Hit-By-Object-Thrown-During-Dune-Part-Two-CCXP-Panel-in-Brazil-3.jpg><p>“It’s nearly here …” Pugh captioned an <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> video featuring the film’s new character posters on Sunday. “#DunePartTwo March 1st 2024. Yipppeeeeeeeee!”</p><p>The sequel will see Pugh reunite onscreen with her Little Women costar Chalamet, 27. Pugh earned a 2020 Best Supporting Actress nomination for her role as Amy March in the <strong>Greta Gerwig</strong>-directed movie, which costarred Chalamet as Theodore “Laurie” Laurence.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Reuniting with Timmy was fantastic. We’d go and have goulash and drink beer and just chat about life,” Pugh shared in a March <a href=# rel=noopener>Buzzfeed</a> Puppy Interview. “I hadn’t seen him in so long, and it was just so wonderful to see how much he’d grown and just the set that he commands and the space that he commands.”</p><p>She continued: “It was just so cool to see this person I’d met, like, four years ago flourish into this just incredibly present, focused and professional actor, which of all the things he was before. But leading the Dune set is huge, you know. It’s a massive, massive production, and it was just really cool to see my friend doing it so well.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGafpJ%2Bnsq%2BvxGanrp%2BYYrWqwIybsGankp%2BypMCMrZ%2Brp6ejeqXB0aKloGWSp667tctmmqilmZh6pLvNZqeappWhfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
