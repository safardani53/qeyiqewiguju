You can take away all the noise and just focus on what’s in front of you like, ‘Let’s make a movie.’”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Alisha and Justin are currently starring in the newly released&nbsp;Palmer, which also stars <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>8-year-old<strong>&nbsp;Ryder Allen</strong></a>. Justin plays the title character, who is a former high school football star returning home after over a decade in prison for attempted murder. He ends up befriending a kid named Sam (Ryder Allen), and takes him under his wing after realizing he is bullied at school and comes from a troubled home. The film was released via Apple TV+ on Jan. 29.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Alisha-Wainwright-ap-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Justin and Alisha caused a stir after they were <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>photographed holding hands</a> in Nov. 2019 while out for an evening in New Orleans, Louisiana — where the film was shot. The pair were specifically seen outdoors at bar The Absinthe House on NoLa’s popular Bourbon Street. Eagle eyed fans also noticed Justin — who married<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong> Jessica Biel</strong></a>, 38, back in 2012 — appeared to be without his wedding ring. The couple share sons <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Silas</strong></a>, 5, and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>baby <strong>Phineas</strong> together</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Shortly afterwards, a rep for the actress clarified that the relationship between Alisha and the&nbsp;Justified&nbsp;singer <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>was professional</a>. “[They’re] filming a movie where their characters have a relationship, which is probably what was [shot.] No validity to any other rumor other than that they are filming together,” a statement said at the time. An eyewitness from the bar also noted that “there was no kissing or hugging or heavy PDA” EXCLUSIVELY to <strong>HollywoodLife</strong>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>After nearly two weeks of silence, Justin himself <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>addressed the incident</a>. “I drank way too much that night and I regret my behavior,” the former N’Sync member wrote via Instagram. “I should have known better. This is not the example I want to set for my son. I apologize to my amazing wife and family for putting them through such an embarrassing situation and I am focused on being the best husband and father I can be,” he went on, pointing out that “nothing happened.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH1ze49tZpqkmai1onnWmqCnr6KetKnAjK2YpaOjYre2v9OipWasmaKvpr7LmqKeZaCWua6x0WaYn6yVp3q0r8Cnm5qkXau2pbHOaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
