Although he told his soon-to-be girlfriend she seemed somewhat arrogant and said during the finale, “I have been attracted to women like that my entire life, and those relationships didn't work because of that. I don't want that anymore.” Travis ultimately walked away with Maya, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">E!
