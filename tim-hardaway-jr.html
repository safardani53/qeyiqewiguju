He is the elder child of a former NBA player, </span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Tim Hardaway Sr</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>. Yolanda Adkins Hardaway is his mother.</span></p><p>In addition, Tim has a younger sister named Nia.</p><p>Although born and raised for some time in California, he soon moved with his family to Florida. Consequently, he enrolled in the Miami Palmetto High School and began schooling there.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Tim-Jr.-with-his-father.jpg><p>Young Tim also took an interest in the sport as he had frequently seen his father play in the league games. After his father’s retirement in 2003, senior Tim became his home coach.</p><p>Hardaway always tried his best to please his father with his game as a kid. However, his father was highly demanding, and sometimes he could be very harsh during the practice sessions.</p><p>Tim Jr., now a feared NBA player, remembers now that he had once thought of giving up basketball as he was frustrated due to his father’s frequent scoldings.</p><p>However, he learned to deal with his father’s hard-hitting criticisms over the years and started delivering well. In fact, his father’s ways of pointing out his mistakes and suggestions for improvement helped him consolidate his skills.</p><p>During his high school matches, his father regularly showed up to observe his game. He now recalls that he often feared seeing his father there. Not because Sr. Hardaway did not want him to be there, but because he did not wish for harsh reviews.</p><p>However, his mother, Yolanda, was always there to support him. The athlete did very well in high school and graduated in 2010.</p><p>Following his high school graduation, he joined the University of Michigan for further studies.</p><h2>Tim Hardaway Jr. | Career</h2><h3>High School Career</h3><p>Tim Hardaway Jr. played high school basketball for the Miami Palmetto High School. He studied in that school after his family moved to Miami as a kid.</p><p>He practiced and played basketball during his high school years under the guidance of various coaches. Hardaway even tried his luck in high school football for almost a year.</p><p>However, he was always meant to make it big in basketball. So, after performing well in his first year, he established contacts with various basketball coaches, including <strong>John Beilein</strong>, the then head coach of the Michigan Wolverines.</p><p>Moreover, he started visiting Beilein’s Elite Camp in Michigan during his junior year. As a result, his performance in his senior high school year was quite astounding.</p><p>He averaged 31.7 points and 7.3 rebounds per game in his final year.</p><p><a href=#><strong>&lt;&lt;&lt; Andre Ingram Bio: NBA & Net Worth >>></strong></a></p><p>The University of Michigan had already shown interest in him and was in contact from his second year. So, as expected, he chose the Michigan Wolverines to pursue his college career after high school.</p><h3>College Career</h3><p>Hardaway joined the Wolverines at a time when they were in dire need of a shooting guard who could shoulder the team’s responsibility perfectly. As their most trusted guard, <strong>Manny Harris</strong>, had just left the team for the NBA, Tim Jr. became their obvious choice.</p><p>However, he was more proficient as a small forward than as a guard; it initially became quite hard for him to adjust.</p><p>After a series of bad games, he later caught up and even earned weekly honors.</p><p>He played 35 matches in the first season, where he recorded 13.9 points and 3.8 rebounds per game. Consequently, he earned a place in the USA U-19 national basketball team to represent them in the FIBA U-19 World Championship.</p><p>Likewise, he played two more college seasons for the Wolverines, which went better for him than his rookie season. His ability to play in the shooting guard position improved very much as well.</p><p>After three successful seasons in which he achieved several honors, he decided to forgo his senior season and go for the 2013 NBA draft.</p><h3>Professional Career</h3><p>The New York Knicks chose Hardaway as the 2013 NBA draft’s first-round 28th pick. Hardaway soon began playing for the Knicks, starting from the NBA Summer League, in which he was noted for his offensive skills.</p><p>The team provided him with enough playtime even though it was his rookie season, and in turn, he played well. He finished his first NBA season with an average of 10.2 points and 1.5 rebounds per game.</p><p>Tim played one more season with the Knicks, in which he suffered numerous injuries, including a concussion and back pain.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Hardaway-Jr.-in-the-Knicks-jersey-665x1024.jpg><p>He missed many games, too, because of injuries and other equally able shooting guards like <a href=#>Iman Shumpert</a> and <strong>J.R. Smith</strong>. However, he had better records than in rookie season, as he averaged 11.5 points per game that season.</p><p>The Knicks traded him to the Atlanta Hawks in 2015. Unfortunately, the team was already full of experienced athletes such as Justin Holiday, <a href=#>Kyle Korver</a>, etc., so he did not get enough playing time.</p><p>As a result, his performance in his first season with the Hawks was not impressive. However, he had remarkable stats in the next season with them.</p><p>He could not quite fit in the Hawks, so he signed a new deal with his former club, the Knicks. The 2017-18 season with the Knicks went pretty well for him, and he stayed with them for the next season too.</p><p>However, after playing for them until the mid-season, the Knicks decided to trade him to the Dallas Mavericks. Although he had signed a four-year contract, he was traded to the Mavericks on January 31, 2019.</p><p>He is still with the Mavericks and going pretty strong in the ongoing 2021-22 season.&nbsp;</p><h2>Tim Hardaway Jr. | Awards & Achievements</h2><p>Some of his awards and achievements include:</p><ul><li>NBA All-Rookie First Team (2014)</li><li>Third-team All-Big Ten (2012)</li><li>First-team All-Big Ten (2013)</li><li>Big Ten All-Freshman Team (2011)</li></ul><h2>Net Worth, Salary & Career Earnings</h2><p>Starting his professional career in 2013, Tim Hardaway Jr. has accumulated a lot of wealth and has an estimated net worth of around $20-$30 million.
