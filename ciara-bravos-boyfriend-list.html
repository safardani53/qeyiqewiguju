Pisces, as the final sign, has absorbed every lesson taught by the preceding signs, including the pleasures and sorrows, hopes and anxieties. It is represented as two fish swimming in opposite directions, symbolizing Pisces' continual divide of attention between imagination and reality.</p><p>She became known to television audiences for her role as Katie Knight on Nickelodeon’s Big Time Rush and as Sarah in Special Agent Oso.
