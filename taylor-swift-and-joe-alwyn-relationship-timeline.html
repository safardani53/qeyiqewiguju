Swift’s relationship with the U.K. native was made public in May 2017. One year later, a source told Us Weekly exclusively that the “Cardigan” singer believed that Alywn is The One.
“She wants to get engaged to him,” the insider said. “She just doesn’t feel as though she has to impress anyone at this point."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

In a <a href=#>Rolling Stone</a> interview with <a href=#><strong>Paul McCartney</strong></a> published in November 2020, she opened up about the desire to create normalcy in her relationship.</p><p>“I, oftentimes, in my anxieties, can control how I am as a person and how normal I act and rationalize things, but I cannot control if there are 20 photographers outside in the bushes and what they do and if they follow our car and if they interrupt our lives,” she explained. “I can’t control if there’s going to be a fake weird headline about us in the news tomorrow.”</p><p>Swift added, “I think that in knowing him and being in the relationship I am in now, I have definitely made decisions that have made my life feel more like a real life and less like just a storyline to be commented on in tabloids.”</p><p>The Favourite actor also discussed the privacy the duo built, telling <a href=#>British Vogue</a> in 2018: “I’m aware people want to know about that side of things. I think we have been successfully very private, and that has now sunk in for people.”</p><p>While the pair’s comments on their love were rare, Swift took moments to gush about her beau. In her 2020 <a href=#>Miss Americana</a> documentary, she explained that the Boy Erased actor’s “wonderful, normal, balanced kind of life” is what attracted her to him.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>However, in April 2023, Us confirmed that the pair split after nearly six years.</p><p>Scroll down to relive their low-key love story:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkwaLFy6ipZqunnrO1ecCnm2ain5p6orjWsqVmqpWhrrW1zqeqoaGgYsGqucSloKedXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
