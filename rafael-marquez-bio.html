Likewise, he was born and raised in Zamora, Michoacan. Besides that, it seems like Rafael is the only child of his parents.</p><p>Talking about his childhood, he played for various youth teams before joining Atlas’ youth team at 14. Later on, he would go on to make his professional debut with Atlas’ senior side in the Primera Division (now Liga MX).</p><p></p><h2>Rafael Marquez | Career, Teams & Achievements</h2><p>When we talk about Marquez’s career, it is nothing sort of extraordinary. To illustrate, Rafael made his professional debut at the tender age of 17 for Atlas.</p><p>After playing there for three years, he signed for the French club, Monaco in 1999 for <strong>$6 million</strong>.</p><p>Subsequently, Marquez had four impressive seasons at Monaco, during which he won the Ligue 1. He was also voted into the Ligue 1 team of the season in 1999-2000.</p><p>As a result, Barcelona swooped in and signed the Mexican international for an undisclosed fee.</p><p>What ensued is the stuff of dreams as Rafael went on to make 163 appearances for the Catalan club scoring nine goals.</p><p>However, it is not his goals that are impressive; instead, it is his trophy haul during his seven years at Barca.</p><p>To illustrate, Marquez won La Liga four times, Supercopa de Espana three times, and UEFA Super Cup, Copa del Rey, and FIFA Club World Cup one time.</p><p>But, the 44-year-old’s most prized achievement has to be winning the UEFA Champions League, not once but twice.</p><p>Thus, after having a wonderful time in Barcelona, Rafael decided to move to the U.S and play for the New York Red Bulls.</p><p>Subsequently, he stayed there for two years before moving back to his home country, Mexico, to play for Leon.</p><p>After that, Marquez played in the Seria A for Hellas Verona during the 2014-15 season. However, his Italian journey lasted for only a year as Rafael moved back to the club he started his professional journey with, Atlas in 2016.</p><p>Thus, after having one hell of a successful career, Marquez decided to hang up his boots in 2018.</p><p>During his 22-year-long, illustrious career, Rafael played in 504 games scoring 23 goals. Added to that, the 44-year-old won an astonishing 21 trophies in that period.</p><h3>Transfer History</h3><p>Rafael started his soccer career for the Atlas U20 team and eventually made it to the senior team on July 1, 1996. He played for Atlas for 3 years until Monaco signed him for a whopping amount of $4665330.</p><p>His next transfer was the biggest transfer throughout his career. He was signed by one of the Spanish Giants, FC Barcelona for $5440522 on July 1, 2003. on July 1, 2010, he was signed for New York Rb as a free transfer.</p><p>His 3 years with the New york Rb came to an end after he was signed by Leon on Jan 1, 2013. On Aug 4, 2014, he signed for Hellas Verona for around $1,034,708.</p><p>In the end, just before taking retirement On Jan 1, 2016, he got traded to Atlas for $207,275 from where he started his career in the beginning.</p><p><strong>Click To know <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Raul Ruidiaz Bio: Salary, Career, Family, Stats, Wife, Net Worth Wiki >></a></strong></p><h3>International Career</h3><p>Marques is the best defender to appear for the Mexican national team.
