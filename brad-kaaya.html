Sadly, his terrible form led him to another disappointment. On October 17, 2017, Panther waived him from their squad.</p><h3>Detroit Lions (Second Spell)</h3><p>A day later, Detroit Lions claimed Kaaya off the Waivers. He joined the practice squad and trained for more than a month.</p><p>Bradley went from a promising young player to an NFL flop in just less than a year. Despite all that, Kaaya didn’t lose hope and continued with his hard work.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.miamiherald.com/sports/college/acc/university-of-miami/d9aw2j/picture146771664/alternates/FREE_1140/UM_KAAYA_DRAFT%20a%20epf><h3>Indianapolis Colts</h3><p>On December 27, 2017, Indianapolis Colts signed him straight off the Detroit Lions practice squad.

Kaaya spent the whole 2018 season playing for the Colts.</p><p>Despite having few good performances in 2018, people clearly saw his weaknesses going into the 2019 season. Ultimately, the Indianapolis Colts waived him from the injured reserve in February 2019.</p><h3>Cincinnati Bengals</h3><p>Once again, Kaaya was claimed off the waivers, this time by Cincinnati Bengals. But the Bengals declined to include him in the seasoned squad, making Kaaya an unrestricted free agent.</p><p><a href=#>Bradley Kaaya on Twitter: “If there’s one thing I’m thankful for, it’s buying Tesla stock instead of buying a Tesla car ?</a></p><p>Currently, he is a club less for two seasons and works as a screenwriter for USC Cinematic Arts.

First, here’s his evaluation of how it looks now:</p><p>“They’ve got an unusual reasoning about themselves,” he said. ”[Offensive line] coach &nbsp;Searels has got them into great shape, and he’s on the hard, he and coach Felder.”</p><p>Those two, Kaaya said, are “beating up the O-line” in workouts, leaving them “exhausted.” They want the line to “get after people, get after D-linemen, go attack defenses.”</p><p>The returning beginners from last year, Kaaya said, “have really stepped up and solidified their spots in the rotation. That’s really big.”</p><p>“They’ve stepped up, and a lot of them have really grown up a lot. We’ll see how it is when the season comes, but right now, it’s a different mentality in that room. I think they’ve matured.”</p><p>So, as per Kaaya, the line has had a change in perspective, an enhancement in strength and conditioning. Players also credit nutrition coach Kyle Bellamy for changing eating habits team-wide and looking stronger and meaner.</p><p>Kaaya revealed something else about the unit of left tackle&nbsp;Trevor Darling, left guard&nbsp;Kc McDermott, center&nbsp;Nick Linder,&nbsp;right guard&nbsp;Danny Isidora, and right tackle&nbsp;Sunny Odogwu,&nbsp;which is expected to open fall camp as the front five.</p><p><h3>Furthermore</h3></p><p>“One thing no one realizes is a lot of those guys were young last year, and a lot of them were playing with injuries,” Kaaya said.</p><p>“A lot of those guys are healthy now. Just about the entire – just about the entire O-line had some kind of major injury that they were playing with the entire season. Guys had torn MCLs, torn meniscuses.”</p><p>“People were saying, ‘Oh, the O-line isn’t looking too good right now,’ certain games people would say that, but it hurt me because those guys were laying it on the line for me.”</p><p>Kaaya remarked how Odogwu, who craved the Sun Bowl after having season-ending surgery to repair a torn MCL, played through that injury during the regular-season finale against Pittsburgh (Odogwu I asked him about it, memorably replied that it “hurt likes”).</p><p>Kaaya also reported that Isidora “had a torn-up knee.” Linder, he said, played with “both his shoulders hurting.”</p><p>And struck the entire game against Florida State with “whiplash. He couldn’t move his neck. He had ice bags on his neck after the game. TV doesn’t see that, but I do.”</p><h3>Additionally</h3><p>Kaaya said the left side of the line (left tackle Darling and left guard McDermott) was “generally healthy.”</p><p>Still, he added that “everyone on the O-line had bumps and bruises and injuries that they played through, that some of them maybe didn’t talk about it … maybe some people ignored it.</p><p>They had all kinds of injuries they played through because they wanted to protect me, and they wanted to help our offense. It means a lot.</p><p>“Those guys are laying it out on the line, and they’re all healthy now. And their weights are down now, too, which is a big part of staying healthy is the right weight for your body, for your frame.”</p><p>“As long as they stay healthy, I think they’ll be pretty good. They should be one of the best offensive line groups in the conference.”</p><p>“I think this year we’ll see a different unit.”</p><p>This is how the entire criticism looked like and took a leap soon after.</p><h2>Brad Kaaya | Net Worth & Salary</h2><p>The precise figure of Bradley Mathias Kaaya Jr.’s net worth is still a mystery to the public.</p><p>However, many online sources claim that he is a millionaire and has garnered such a big net worth from his football career and ancestral property.</p><p>“According to sources, Brad Kaaya has a net worth of $1.5 Million.”</p><p>He is currently living a happy and lavish life in Los Angeles, California. Mostly, he is seen traveling around with his girlfriend, Megan.</p><p>Moreover, he is fond of wearing fashionable clothes and watching movies and TV Series.</p><h2>Social Media Presence:</h2><p><a href=#>Instagram</a> : 34.8k followers</p><p><a href=#>Twitter</a>: 93.2k followers</p><h2>Some FAQs:</h2><h3>Is Brad Kaaya still in the NFL?</h3><p>Kaaya meets Jeff Driskel and Tom Savage as the popular reserve quarterbacks to <a href=#>Andy Dalton</a>.
