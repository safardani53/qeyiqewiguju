In an interview with <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Rolling Stone</a>, John goes on and on about his favorite subject …. himself.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>When he’s not talking about drinking scotch, taking Ambien, his “poop jokes,” vintage watches, or masturbating, John whines about trying to find the perfect girl. &nbsp;“He wants a girlfriend, a real life-partner girlfriend. &nbsp;It’s been a long time. &nbsp;And it’s just not happening,” the RS article conveys.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>He says, “Do you think it’s going to take meeting someone who I admire more than I admire myself? But isn’t it also about a beautiful vagina? Aren’t we talking about a matrix of a couple different things here? Like, you need to have them be able to go toe-to-toe with you intellectually. &nbsp;But don’t they also have to have a vagina you could pitch a tent on and just camp out on for, like, a weekend? Doesn’t that have to be there too? The Joshua Tree of vaginas?”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Can you imagine <strong>Jennifer Aniston</strong> dating this guy?? John, we’re sure most women don’t have any clue what you’re talking about … but we can guess that your musings, like this one, are the reason girls often end up in a hotel room with you, decide to walk out instead of hooking up, but then ask for your autograph before they leave.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Here is the abridged version of John’s very long interview!</p><ul><li><strong>He calls himself an asshole for breaking up with Jen and he still misses her: </strong>“I’ve never gotten over it – it was one of the worst times in my life.”</li><li><strong>He wants a girlfriend: </strong>“All I want to do now is fuck the girls I have already fucked, because I cannot fathom explaining myself to somebody who can’t believe I’d be interested in them.”</li><li><strong>He’s obsessed with masturbating: </strong>“I am the new generation of masturbator. I have masturbated myself out of serious problems in my life… I do it because I want to take a brain bath. It’s like a hot whirlpool for my brain.”</li><li><strong>He thinks threesomes are awesome: </strong>“You know what? It wasn’t swarmy. It was awesome.”</li></ul><p id=content-paragraph-7>If you REALLY want a girlfriend, like you say you do, try doing something that seems really difficult … listen to them, instead of the sound of your own voice.</p><h3><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">For more on John Mayer click here!</a></h3><p id=content-paragraph-8><strong>Get More on John Mayer: :</strong></p><li>HollyEWWW!: John Mayer Warns London’s Women: I Want to Get One of You Preggers!</li><li>Jessica Simpson’s New Years Resolution: Stop Accepting Texts From My Exes!</li><li>Pete Wentz, Justin Long & Nick Cannon: You Are All Totally Whipped!
