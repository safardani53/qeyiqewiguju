I was&nbsp;talking to my mom this morning, and I was just thinking about what I’m gonna say when I get up here,” <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Voice coach</a> said. His mom then told her son that she wished his late brother,&nbsp;<strong>Richie Shelton</strong>, who died in a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>car accident</a> in 1990, could be there. “She says to me, ‘I wish Richie could’ve been here to see this and everything that you’ve done.’ So I dedicate my star on this Walk of Fame to my brother Richie,” Blake concluded.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Blake-Shelton-Gwen-Stefani-Walk-Of-Fame-Ceremony-ss-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Prior to Blake’s sweet speech, the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>No Doubt frontwoman</a> herself took to the podium to celebrate her hubby and deliver a loved-up speech in his honor. Gwen kicked off the speech by listing some of the Oklahoma native’s accomplishments including “28 number one singles and 23 seasons on&nbsp;The Voice.” She called him a “one-of-a-kind guy” and noted how proud she and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her sons</a> are of him. “He’s humble, he’s genuine, and trust me, wherever we go everybody feels like they know&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Blake Shelton</a>,” she added.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Later, the blonde beauty declared that her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>leading man</a> is a symbol of a plethora of dreams. “Blake, you are a rare human being. The reason Blake Shelton is here today on the Hollywood Walk of Fame is because you are part of the country dream, the Hollywood dream and you are part of the American Dream,” the 53-year-old said. Before she walked off stage, Gwen admitted that he is her “dream come true” and exclaimed, “I love you!” While at the ceremony, the “Don’t Speak” songstress rocked a chic white dress with black <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>polka dots</a> and styled it with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>thigh-high leather boots</a> and fishnet stockings.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Blake-Shelton-Gwen-Stefani-Walk-Of-Fame-Ceremony-ss-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Blake, for his part, kept his look classic in a a black button-up shirt and suit jacket, but opted for <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>blue jeans</a> in true country star fashion. Not only did his spouse show up to support him, but her three sons <strong>Kingston</strong>, 16, <strong>Zuma</strong>, 14, and <strong>Apollo</strong>, 9, were also in attendance.
