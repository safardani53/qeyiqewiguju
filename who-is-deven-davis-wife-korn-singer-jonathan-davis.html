On the same day as her death, Jonathan filed a restraining order against her.</strong> In the court docs, Jonathan claimed she was allegedly causing emotional harm to her kids via neglect caused by her alleged drug use.

She had a previous history of drug use.</strong> According to Jonathan’s filing, Deven was “constantly under the influence of the nitrous oxide, cocaine and Norco.” On top of that, Jonathan has claimed that recently, when he took his children to visit her, he found her drug dealer boyfriend passed out on a couch, her passed out on a bed, and drugs and drug paraphernalia floating inside a toilet bowl. In addition, Jonathan claims that when she was using she would “routinely bring home unsavory characters, including strangers. Some of these people are random fans of my music who she allows to come into the house, go into the master bedroom closet and try on my clothes.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5><strong>3.
