He took me over to a secluded area and asked me to hit him and I was like ‘I’m not just going to hit you. You want to square up?” And then he sucker-punched me so I did what I did.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>The results are now viral video history. Luke, a former wrestler, used his skills to wrap a chokehold around Katt after the comedian nailed&nbsp;a sucker punch. Luke said his had a swollen face but he wasn’t hurt. Still, the police are investigating the brawl&nbsp;to see if Katt somehow violated his bail&nbsp;agreement.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>While Luke claims that Katt started the skirmish, eyewitnesses to the brawl EXCLUSIVELY tell <strong>HollywoodLife.com </strong>“that kid purposely provoked [Katt] into the fight. He told all his friends way in advance that he was going to get in [Katt’s] face, talk smack and not back down until Katt hit him.” The only reason the video was caught on video, the source tells <strong>HollywoodLife.com</strong>, was that “he told [all his friends] to film it.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5><img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hollywoocom-20&l=pf4&o=1" alt width=1 height=1 border=0 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p id=content-paragraph-6>The extended and uncut video seems to side with Katt. A large squad of kids, led allegedly by Luke, approached Katt while he was resting against a brick wall. The kid mocked Katt for being out of breath before telling him to stand up. When Katt got to his feet, he pushed against the wall and the situation then explodes when Katt throws a punch. So who’s really telling the truth?</p><p id=content-paragraph-7><img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hollywoocom-20&l=pf4&o=1" alt width=1 height=1 border=0 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Whether Luke or Katt started the fight, one thing is for certain: Katt came out the loser. The Internet <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>made sure he knew that</a>. His fans mocked and blasted Katt for being whooped by a teenager (who was initially reported to be in 7th grade) while some were worried that Katt was out of his control. In fact, some of the comedian’s closest friends are urging him to seek mental health after this latest embarrassment.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Who do you think started the fight, <strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>? Katt or the teen?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlmZH10e5FtZqSZpKl6uLXLpaCapaNiwLWt0a2cnWWWnrSpwIytnJ6mXaHCrLGMsJisoF2lwq%2Bvx2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
