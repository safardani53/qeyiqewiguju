The former wife of Playboy founder Hugh Hefner was one of the stars of The Girls Next Door, a show that focused on Hef’s polygamous life with three blonde brides.
Even in the less-PC era in which it debuted, the show was a source of controversy, and to say it hasn’t aged well would be putting it very mildly."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I am mine," Hefner wrote, <a href=#>acccording to</a> People magazine.</p><p>She noted that she "was living for other people before, to make others happy, suffering internally in the process."</p><p>Hefner added that her followers won’t be seeing any more graphic content on her social media accounts, and while that move initially resulted in a drop in numbers, her engagement stats are recovering nicely.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/cs_srgb><p>"Over five years, my account has shifted from not always safe for work posts to my REAL safe for work life. The real me," Crystal explained.</p><p>"Certain photos grow followings fast. In short, sex sells.</p><p>"I don’t know whether I felt empowered by dressing scantily clad, showing cleavage, etc …or if I just felt it was expected of me or what … but now I can confidently and 100% proudly say, modesty is what empowers me these days," she continued.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/cs_srgb><p>"And because it feels so much better internally, it will probably be this way for the rest of my life."</p><p>Crystal says that her Instagram following "tanked hard" at first, and she "saw followers drop by the thousands every day."</p><p>She adds that "now it has shifted" and "most days the count is growing."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>There’s also been a change in the nature of her following.</p><p>"Now my women followers are giving the men followers a run for their money," Crystal wrote.</p><p>"Now I truly feel I have an army of supporters that care and see an actual soul behind the lens. For that I thank you,"</p><p>She said that going forward, she plans to "make it my mission to try and help in all ways that I can while staying true to myself," adding:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"I hope all of you can stay true to yourself and to what feels right for you as well, because there’s a certain power you get from that you can’t find anywhere else. I love you."</p><p>This is not the first time that Crystal has spoken about unrealistic body standards and the harm they can do to women’s psyches.</p><p>In 2016 <a href=#>Hefner had her breast implants removed</a>, explaining that she did so as a way of feeling more natural and distancing heself from her past.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/cs_srgb><p>In 2020, Crystal explained that she almost died from a cosmetic procedure that involved a "transfer of fat."</p><p>"Our culture is a trap and makes women feel terrible about themselves," she wrote at the time.</p><p>"Social media makes it worse. Advertisements make it worse. Physically fake people make it worse (I was one of them)," Hefner continued.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"How our culture defines beauty makes it impossible to keep up with. Women are overly sexualized. I know from the worst kind of experience."</p><p>Crystal says she bought into the lie that women should only be valued for their looks, and she’s still fightint to rid her psyche of that toxic message.</p><p>"For ten years my value was based on how good my physical body looked. I was rewarded and made a living based on my outer appearance," Crystal added.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"To this day I need to write reminders of why I’m worthy that have nothing to do with my physical appearance to convince myself that I’m enough."</p><p>We wish Crystal all the best in her journey toward self-actualization.</p><p>And we’d like to thank her for her courage in fighting this battle publicly.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tqX2V%2BcK%2FRsqqtmZxitaayzZ6pZpyVobK1sdJmpa6clWK9qbvTqKpmnqKkum61za2cq6aVqXqqec2enJ2dlGKyt7HRsqto</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
