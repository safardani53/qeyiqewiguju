She has been a major support system for the 46-year-old, especially following his horrific <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>car accident</a> in Feb. 2021. Tiger was rushed to the hospital after the single car crash on Feb. 21, and had to have emergency surgery on his leg. His recovery took months as he learned to walk again, and Erica was by his side.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Although Tiger has acknowledged that he will never have a full-time career as a professional golfer again, he hasn’t given up on the sport. Just eight months after the accident, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>he was spotted</a> back on the golf course. In Nov. 2021, he shared the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>first video</a> of himself on the course. This came after months of <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>needing crutches</a> to help him simply walk around, so it was a major improvement.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>In Dec. 2021, Tiger played in his first <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>post-car accident golf tournament</a>. He joined his son&nbsp;<strong>Charlie</strong>, now 13, for the PNC tournament, and the duo came in second place. Tiger shares Charlie, as well as a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>14-year-old daughter</a>,&nbsp;<strong>Sam</strong>, with his ex-wife,&nbsp;<strong>Elin Nordegren</strong>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>For the most part, Tiger and Erica have kept their relationship out of the public eye during their nearly five years together. However, at the beginning of 2022, they were <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>photographed at the airport</a> together, seemingly heading on a vacation or returning from one. Clearly, these two are still going strong!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ze5BwZq2hl5q%2FbsPOqJusZZWntqStjKGcq6WRo3qlrdOeZKehl53BbrzHqKuoq18%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
