So, Rachel went to LeBron James's advisor, Adam Mendelsohn, as well as LeBron's agent, Rich Paul, and she told them (via a conference call) that she felt like Maria was only promoted because ESPN was attempting to make up for their abysmal record on diversity. She implied that Maria was only getting the job because she's Black, not because she is qualified and talented.</p><p>She said, "I wish Maria Taylor all the success in the world ‚Äî she covers football, she covers basketball,‚Äù Nichols said in July 2020 via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The New York Times</a>. ‚ÄúIf you need to give her more things to do because you are feeling pressure about your crappy longtime record on diversity ‚Äî which, by the way, I know personally from the female side of it ‚Äî like, go for it.

In fact, the only person to get in trouble was a digital producer named Kayla Johnson, who is Black. She was the one who told HR she sent the video to Maria, and as a result, Kayla was suspended for two weeks without any pay and then was seemingly punished with "less desirable tasks at work."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Rachel responded to The NYT, saying she was frustrated and ‚Äúunloading to a friend about ESPN‚Äôs process, not about Maria.‚Äù She added, ‚ÄúMy own intentions in that conversation, and the opinion of those in charge at ESPN, are not the sum of what matters here ‚Äî if Maria felt the conversation was upsetting, then it was, and I was the cause of that for her.‚Äù</p><p>She says that she reached out to Maria to apologize, but Maria hasn't responded to her calls or texts.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Rachel then went on to say that she was "hurt" that this conversation was recorded in the first place. ‚ÄúI was shaken that a fellow employee would do this, and that other employees, including some of those within the NBA project, had no remorse about passing around a spy video of a female co-worker alone in her hotel room," she said. She added, "I would in no way suggest that the way the comments came to light should grant a free pass on them being hurtful to other people."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">ESPN has now canceled 'The Jump,' but Rachel says there's "more to come."</h2><p>According to David Roberts (ESPN's senior vice president of production), the decision to cancel Rachel's show was completely mutual. "We mutually agreed that this approach regarding our NBA coverage was best for all concerned," he said. "Rachel is an excellent reporter, host and journalist, and we thank her for her many contributions to our NBA content."</p><p>Rachel kept her own references to the cancelation of her show brief. She shared on Twitter that "The Jump was never built to last forever," then assured her fans and followers that there was more to come.
