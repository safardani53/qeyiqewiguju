“She came through, she brought food / She got f—ed, she knew wassup / She think I’m the realest out / And I say ‘Damn, that makes two of us’ / Oh that look like what’s her name / Chances are it is what’s her name / Chances are, if she was acting up / Then I f—ed her once and never f—ed again / She could have a Grammy, I still treat that a- like a nominee / Just need to know what that p—- like so one time, it’s fine with me."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Although Drake doesn’t name any names, he hints he’s talking about Rihanna by mentioning her Grammies, her hit song “What’s my Name?,” and the fact their their romance was short-lived.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>We think that these rappers should keep their feelings about Rihi between the people the issue pertains to, and not spread their dirty laundry around in verse. But we want to know what you think about Drake’s attack on Rihanna? Should he have dissed her in his latest single?</p><h3>Nicole Fukuoka</h3><p id=content-paragraph-7><strong>More Rihanna:</strong></p><li>Chris Brown Disses Rihanna After She Unfollowed Him On Twitter</li><li>Rihanna Unfollowed Chris Brown On Twitter — Did He Call Her A ‘B***h’?</li><li>Chris Brown’s New Diss: Did He Call Rihanna A ‘Ho’?</li><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWliZH12e5BqZp2qkaCybrDIrKqeq12ntqmtzaeYZqGeYsCwusZmpahlnJ6ycA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
