Like her sister, Rhonda has also been an actress. She’s starred in TV series like&nbsp;Another World and had a role in the 1998 biopic miniseries The Temptations,&nbsp;per her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>IMDb</a>. She also appeared alongside her sister in an episode of&nbsp;Girlfriends&nbsp;in 2000. After that she stepped away from the acting world and released two albums of her own, and had even toured with Diana. She released her debut album in 2004, and has continued to release singles, with her most recent single being 2020’s “Lay in Major 1.” She’s also become a motivational speaker, according to<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> her website</a>!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Tracee-Ellis-Ross-Siblings-SS-embed-4.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Rhonda has also been married to her husband&nbsp;<strong>Rodney Kendrick&nbsp;</strong>since 1996, and the<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> pair have a son&nbsp;</a><strong>Raif-Henok Emmanuel,&nbsp;</strong>12. He’s even made appearances to help honor his grandma at award shows, as he’s gotten older, stealing the show with his cute-ness! It’s clear that Rhonda and Tracee are close. She posted a celebratory throwback photo of the two girls, when they were young on the set of The Wiz, with their mom wrapping her arms around them, to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her Instagram</a> in March 2022.</p><h2><strong>Chudney Ross</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>Tracee’s younger sister&nbsp;<strong>Chudney,&nbsp;</strong>46, has mostly stayed out of the spotlight, but she has done a bit of work in the entertainment business! She was a producer on the show&nbsp;Mesmerized&nbsp;and a production manager for the series&nbsp;Fame&nbsp;in the early 2000s, according to her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>IMDb</a>. Even though she may not work in TV anymore, Chudney has continued to be a creative person, like most of her family. She authored the kids’ book<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>&nbsp;Lone Bean&nbsp;</a>in 2012, and it’s clear that she’s an avid reader and book lover.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Tracee-Ellis-Ross-Siblings-SS-embed-3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>The mother of two used to run a family-oriented shop called <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Books and Cookies</a>, that specialized in, well, children’s books and baked goods! While the shop has closed, Chudney has continued to share the love of Books and Cookies with virtual and pop-up events. “We shared our love of reading and our favorite books and celebrated countless birthdays with books and cookies (and cake)!” the website said. Other than books, she’s also the “Chief Kid Officer” of The Jane Club, which is an organization that “strive[s] to be the mother of all workspaces we are committed to creating a culture wherein people can be their whole selves – across race, gender, sexuality, class, ability, and age,” according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>its website.</a></p><h2><strong>Ross Næss</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>After Tracee’s mom and Robert divorced in 1977, Diana married businessman <strong>Arne Næss Jr.&nbsp;</strong>in 1985. Arne had a son&nbsp;<strong>Christoffer</strong> and two daughters&nbsp;<strong>Katinka&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Leona&nbsp;</strong>from his first marriage, and after the pair divorced in 2000, he had two sons with his girlfriend&nbsp;<strong>Camilla Astrup,&nbsp;</strong>before his death in 2004. Diana gave birth to Tracee’s younger brother&nbsp;<strong>Ross,&nbsp;</strong>34, in October 1987. Ross has also dabbled in movies, being the executive producer for the 2014 film&nbsp;Acid Girls.&nbsp;As a child, he appeared alongside his mom in her “When You Tell Me That You Love Me” music video, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>IMDb</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Tracee-Ellis-Ross-Siblings-SS-embed-5.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>Ross is also quite the entrepreneur! His Instagram bio lists him as the co-founder of the nightclub experience <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Warwick LA</a>, the since-closed <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Like A Gentleman barbershop</a>, and the music and food festival<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Untapped</a>. Other than his many business ventures, Ross is also a father to two beautiful boys&nbsp;<strong>Lief&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Indigo.&nbsp;</strong>When he and his wife Kimberly, tied the knot in 2017, they’d already had Lief, and Indigo was on the way. Tracee was even one of her sister-in-law’s bridesmaids for the wedding, according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Harper’s Bazaar.</a></p><h2><strong>Evan Ross</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>Diana had her youngest son&nbsp;<strong>Evan,&nbsp;</strong>33, in 1988. Evan has had the most similar career to his older sister, also pursuing a career in acting. While his most well-known role was for playing Messalla in&nbsp;The Hunger Games: Mockingjay&nbsp;films, he’s appeared in numerous movies and TV shows over the years. Like his sister Rhonda, he also appeared in an episode of Tracee’s sitcom&nbsp;Girlfriends, but it’s clear he’s been making a name for himself in the entertainment industry. Most recently, he starred in the upcoming crime drama&nbsp;Black Water Transit,&nbsp;but he’s also set to appear in the upcoming movies&nbsp;HeadShop&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Loneliest Boy in the World, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>IMDb</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Tracee-Ellis-Ross-Siblings-SS-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-10>Evan has also been married to&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Ashlee Simpson</a>&nbsp;</strong>since 2014, and it’s clear that Tracee and her sister-in-law have bonded and forged a friendship. When Ashlee posted a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>sexy shower photo</a> to celebrate her husband’s birthday, Tracee had the obvious big sister response to share a laughing, crying emoji as a reaction to the photo, per<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>&nbsp;Today</a>. With Ashlee, Evan has two daughters&nbsp;<strong>Jagger&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Ziggy,&nbsp;</strong>and he’s also a step-dad to her son&nbsp;<strong>Bronx,&nbsp;</strong>who she shares with her ex&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Pete Wentz.</a>&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9OrmJydlWKyrbjIrGSrp6OoerS1waWgp5%2BjYoF3hJRqaGxn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
