Don’t forget to catch the season 5 premiere of <i>Billy on the Street</i> (Tuesdays starting November 15 at 10:30 p.m. ET) with guest star <b>Jon Hamm</b>.</p><p>1. I’m a big sucker for Christmastime in NYC.</p><p>2. I support the nonprofit Everytown for Gun Safety.</p><p>3. I was a bartender at <i>The Lion King </i>on Broadway.</p><p>4. The best advice I ever got was from [producer] <b>Michael Patrick King</b>, who said to always “follow the green lights” when it comes to career or creative decisions.</p><p>5. I’m very allergic to cats.</p><p>6. . . . but my first pet as a child was a cat I named Jovi, because I was a huge Bon Jovi fan.</p><p>7. My favorite color is blue.</p><p>8. I mutter “oh, God” throughout the day. You can guess whether that’s because I’m spiritual or disgusted.</p><p>9. I have a <i>Late Show With David Letterman</i> hat that I will never throw away.</p><p>10. My tweet during the second debate [“Someone please explain to <b>Donald Trump</b> how the Senate works and how the government works and how vaginas work and also Russia”] was one of my biggest ever. But who’s counting?</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Someone please explain to Donald Trump how the Senate works and how the government works and how vaginas work and also Russia</p><p>— billy eichner (@billyeichner) <a href=#>October 10, 2016</a></p><p>11. I have never turned on the stove in either my NYC or L.A. apartment.</p><p>12. I once dreamed I had lunch with <b>Sarah Jessica Parker</b>, who I didn’t know at the time, and when I woke up I was upset it was only a dream because I loved her. Now she’s my friend, which is insane.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sjp_billy-eefd9f78-aedc-49f6-9138-cf2d38915fef.jpg><p>13. I never learned how to drive a car, but it’s probably time to learn!</p><p>14. As a kid, I was a very good singer.</p><p>15. I chew on things I shouldn’t, like pen caps and straws. I’m not proud of it.</p><p>16. The last thing I read was <b>Leah Remini</b>’s book <i>Troublemaker</i>. It was riveting.</p><p>17. I can’t live without cold-brew coffee. Kinda basic, but I don’t care.</p><p>18. My first crush was <b>Keith Hernandez</b>, the first baseman for the 1986 New York Mets!</p><p>19. I could watch [the 1993 film] <i>Six Degrees of Separation</i> over and over again.</p><p>20. Every morning I go on Twitter, Deadline, <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i>, NPR, Instagram and <i>Playbill</i>.</p><p>21. I once ran into my friend the late, great Joan Rivers on a plane. I forgot my garment bag when we landed, and she walked me into the Admirals Club and had them escort me back to the plane to make sure I got it back. I miss Joan.</p><p></p><p>22. I’ve been called so many variations on Billy. As you can imagine, “Billy, Don’t Be a Hero” is hilarious every time.</p><p>23. My perfect day off would consist of sleeping in, listening to music and walking around Manhattan with friends on a crisp fall day. By the way, I’m not sure I’ve ever actually done this.</p><p>24. I’m not embarrassed to say I think <b>Paris Hilton</b>’s “Stars Are Blind” is a perfect pop song!</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>25. Our dream guest for <i>Billy on the Street</i> has been and always will be <b>Meryl Streep</b>.</p><span class=caption></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJmipJyueqa1wqGlnqpdZ4JuwMeipaCrXa68tnnDqKWtZZujvLh5wJumrqxdorJuw5Ntb2xvZWQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
