But I am and I asked her on that episode if you don’t want him, can I have him.”</p><p>Subsequently, the social media personality shared that she eventually began seeing the aforementioned individual. She recounted their initial date, narrating how they went to one of Los Angeles’ most upscale hotels.</p><p>Upon entering the hotel, they were greeted by the hotel staff in the lobby and proceeded to a private lounge, where they had the opportunity to deepen their connection.</p><p>During their conversation, Mongeau also pointed out that the person she’s currently dating is younger than her. However, she clarified that this age difference doesn’t bother her, emphasizing her belief that a person’s maturity, particularly in terms of their personality and character.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Following the podcast, The Tea Tok reposted the clip and captioned, “Tana Mongeau justifies dating a 21-year-old rich kid on a now-deleted episode of the # canceled podcast.”</p><p>Upon seeing the post, one person commented, “Tbh, once you hit your 20s, an age gap doesn’t matter,” another chimed in, “She’s living her best life, to be honest. It’s not like she’s a cougar, I think y’all need to loosen up.”</p><p>Moreover, in April 2023, there were rumors that the internet personality was romantically involved with Jeff Wittek. However, these speculations were swiftly put to rest when Wittek appeared on the ‘Impulsive’ podcast.</p><p>When the podcast host, Logan Paul, asked Wittek if he was dating Mongeau, he responded with a straightforward, “No, absolutely not. Are you out of your mind? I’m not that blind.”</p><p>He then quickly realized the bluntness of his response and playfully apologized, saying, “I’m just kidding. I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Tana Mongeau was once married to Jake Paul</h2><p>Mongeau and Paul <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">started</a> dating in early 2018, and just after a few months, they made the significant decision to tie the knot in July 2019.</p><p>The internet personality had a total of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">three</a> wedding dresses for her special day. She wore her first dress, a meticulously detailed and curve-hugging piece, upon her arrival at the wedding venue.</p><p>For the actual vow exchange, she transitioned into a stunning pink ombre ball gown adorned with ruffles. Her final outfit change of the night featured a silver mini dress, accompanied by matching thigh-high boots for the post-wedding festivities.</p><p>In contrast, Paul opted for a single outfit for the wedding: a white Dior suit complete with a fedora, a leather crossbody bag, and a coordinating umbrella.</p><p>Similarly, the former couple’s wedding was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">livestreamed</a> as a pay-per-view event, drawing a crowd of 66,000 devoted fans who each paid $50 to watch the ceremony.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/married-1.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Tana Mongeau and Jake Paul were in a relationship for approximately two years. (Source: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Insider</a>)</p><p>However, rumors began to circulate about the authenticity of their marriage when some noticed the $125 cubic zirconium ring on Mongeau’s hand and the absence of a marriage license. Paul’s older brother, Logan Paul, also expressed skepticism about the entire relationship.</p><p>Nearly a year after her marriage to Paul, the internet personality appeared on BFF’s podcast, where she admitted to the fact that their wedding was fake and they were not legally married.</p><p>She stated, “The wedding was fake. There’s nothing you can ever say to say that it wasn’t, I guess. You know? I mean don’t get me wrong but we were like yes, we feel like this is a vibe like let’s do it. let’s make this video, this is crazy, all this stuff is crazy, you know what I mean?”</p><p>She added, “But like, the emotion of it all was real. It’s still real. It’s real for me, it always will be real. I loved Jake more than anyone I’ve ever loved and like probably will always love him.”</p><p>However, after being in an on-and-off relationship throughout most of 2019, the couple ultimately <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">decided</a> to part ways in January 2020.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifnJa6sMHRm6yfnl6YvK57zZ6urGeklruiecyopaCdkap6o7vYn6minZ6ZeqStzZycpaSVmXw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
