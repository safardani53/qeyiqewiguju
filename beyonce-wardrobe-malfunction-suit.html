After all, this is a woman who is not only <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>synonymous with the hashtag #flawless</a>, but has cultivated a public persona so expertly curated and presented that she and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>her husband Jay Z</a> have often been accused of being leaders of the Illuminati.

The singer paired her ’70s-inspired matching blazer and flared pants with her long performance braid, velvet burgundy Prada platform heels, and no shirt underneath, a sartorial choice that would come to haunt her over the course of the evening ahead.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">RELATED PHOTOS: Oh, Baby! Beyoncé’s Stylish Blue Streak</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As Beyoncé left the restaurant and headed for her car, it seems that the pop star suffered a minor nip slip. Bey being Bey however, she immediately identified the problem, casually sliding her hand up over her breast, and nonchalantly continuing on her way.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Of course, this blazer faux pas comes hot on the heels of yet another on-stage slip-up at her Tidal X: 1015 performance at Brooklyn’s Barclays Center.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Mid-song it seems that Beyoncé realized her ear had started to bleed after she whipped her waist-long braid just a little too hard, causing it to get tangled up in one of her hoop earrings and rip it out of her earlobe. In case you needed any more proof Bey was a part-time deity: as you can see in the clip above she wasn’t even close to phased by the pain or the blood, finishing off the show without a second thought. The artist formerly known as Sasha Fierce must have taken that Bob Marley lyric to heart because, clearly, when her music hits, she feels no pain.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>What do you think of Beyoncé’s two wardrobe malfunctions this weekend?
