“So I’m doing my cranberry sauce, and as Chandler would say, ‘Chanberry sauce.’” her husband, David Beckham, began in the Instagram Story video posted on Sunday, December 24, referring to the Friends character. “And over here …”
The camera then panned to Victoria, 49, who bent over as she reached for the trash cans."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

(The pair have since welcomed sons Brooklyn, 24, Romeo, 21, Cruz, 18 and daughter Harper, 12.)</p><p>“It was the hardest period [of our marriage] because it felt like the world was against us,” she added. “Here’s the thing — we were against each other, if I’m being completely honest.</p><p>She continued: “Up until Madrid, sometimes it felt like us against everybody else, but we were together, we were connected, we had each other. But when we were in Spain, it didn’t really feel like we had each other either. And that’s sad. I can’t even begin to tell you how hard it was and how it affected me.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>David, for his part, was visibly emotional as he discussed the alleged infidelity and how it impacted his wife.</p><p>“Victoria is everything to me, to see her hurt was incredibly difficult, but we’re fighters,” he said. “And at that time, we needed to fight for each other, we needed to fight for our family. And what we had was worth fighting for.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGavoZOpvLO1wGaZnpubna6uecmoop6rXZ%2Byr7rIn5yrZZykvabGjJ2mnqueqXqprdWeZK2nXZq6scDYZp%2Beql2pv6K%2Fx2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
