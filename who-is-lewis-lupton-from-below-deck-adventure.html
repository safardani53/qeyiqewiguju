The crew will comprise Lewis Lupton as the yacht’s bosun and will be led by Captain Kerry Titheradge.

Below Deck Sailing Yacht, Below Deck Mediterranean, and Below Deck Down Under were the others. Meanwhile, viewers may anticipate the premiere of the new program Below Deck Adventure.</p><p>According to the official synopsis:</p><p>“In the newest installment of the Emmy Award-nominated series, Bravo takes viewers beyond the deck and off the yacht as guests paraglide, explore caverns, and enjoy adventurous helicopter flights over the Norwegian Fjords.”</p><h2>Lewis Lupton enjoys sailing and touring.</h2><p>Lewis Lupton can be seen directing the deck staff aboard yacht Mercury in Below Deck Adventure, although this is not his first time in such a position.&nbsp;According to his bio on Bravo’s website, he was promoted from deckhand to first officer (a job description comparable to that of a bosun) in no time at his former work.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Lewis-Lupton-1.jpg alt="Lewis Lupton" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>According to his Bravo profile:</p><p>“A graduate of the United Kingdom Sailing Academy, Lewis Lupton joins Mercury as bosun with experience working in the Mediterranean and an avid love for sailing. On his previous yacht, he quickly rose from deckhand to first officer and is eager to work with a larger team and boat.”</p><p>The UK native is not all business and no recreation; despite his Instagram having fewer postings, he clearly enjoys traveling. His Instagram feeds reveal that he has swam with sharks in Exumas, Bahamas, and has gone to Milan (Italy), Long Beach (New York), and Corinth (Greece). Lewis recently had the pleasure at the “Y Not Festival 2022,” which took place in Derbyshire, England, in October.</p><h2>Below Deck Adventure: What to Expect? Lewis Lupton</h2><p>Fans of the Below Deck shows are aware of the difficult situations that a bosun is put in because he not only manages the deck team but also serves as the captain’s right hand. In a preview for Below Deck Adventure season 1, bosun Lewis Lupton was seen getting involved in some contentious situations.&nbsp;In the video, his deckhand Kyle Dickard was shown opposing Lewis’ authority, which might lead to a lot of drama aboard. The bosun was also seen romancing stew Oriana Schneps in one of the teaser moments when the two were in the yacht’s jacuzzi.</p><p>“I’m not going to kiss and tell about Oriana, but let’s just say there’s something going on behind the bubbles that people don’t see.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Lewis-Lupton-2.jpg alt="Lewis Lupton" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Meanwhile, according to the official description of Lewis and his crew on Bravo’s website:</p><p>“Bosun Lewis Lupton and deckhands Nathan Morely, Michael Gilman, and Kyle Dickard come together in this frigid-water location as some situations become hot when expectations aren’t reached and interpersonal disputes arise while seeking to satisfy their visitors.”</p><p>Along with the previously listed cast members, the remaining members include chef Jessica Condy, head stew Faye Clarke, and stew Kasie Faddah.&nbsp;The first episode of Below Deck Adventure season 1 will debut on Bravo on Tuesday, November 1, 2022, at 9.00 PM ET.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Below Deck Adventure</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Lewis Lupton</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiuoaddnsBuuMSwoKxlnKq9tbvNZp2rp51ir6a4zrBknZ2ToHqisNWepa2topp8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
