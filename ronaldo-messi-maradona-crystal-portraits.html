Mauricio Benitez,better known as Mr Bling, has been creating celebrity portraits made out of Swarovski crystals since 2010, after initially experimenting with bejeweled clothing.
He received worldwide acclaim three years later, when a glitzy piece he gifted Barcelona legend Lionel Messi went viral, and was claimed to be worth £34million.
Since then, the greatest names in football have commissioned Mr Bling artwork, including Cristiano Ronaldo, Neymar Jr, David Beckham, Ronaldinho, and Diego Maradona - some paying up to £150,000 for the privilege."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>
