The closest and most recent glimpse into that aspect of his life came on Mar. 3, 2022, when Steve posted a since-deleted snapshot on Instagram of him snuggled up to an unidentified man. Steve was sitting in his lap, but the other individual was not tagged or named.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is Steve Lacy's sexuality?</h2><p>What we do know is that Steve has suggested in the past that he has a fluid sexuality. Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Attitude</a>, when an anonymous user asked Steve during a Tumblr chat whether he was bisexual or straight, he simply stated "I’m human."</p><p>Pressed even further by fans to reveal if he’d ever date a guy, he went on to say, "Sure, why not?"</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Then, another anonymous user took things to another level, asking Steve why he has a "blatantly anti-black preference in partners." To this question, the singer had quite a bit to say.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"The reason for it all isn’t anti black … at all. growing up around black males, they were always my competitors," he led off by telling fans. "I never viewed or saw myself doing anything sexual with my neighbors ... I literally, like I said, see them as brothers. As much as you or whoever thinks this sounds like bulls--t, it’s from a real place."</p><p>Steve concluded his point by noting, "I’m a [n-word] from Compton; I don’t dislike black people, I prefer to live here and be around POC because I love black people, I’m just not attracted to black boys. That is it. I still love them and want them to do well in life, we just won’t date. Sorry."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How old is Steve Lacy?</h2><p>As of the time of writing, Steve is 24 years old.
