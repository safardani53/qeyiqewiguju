It was their way to thank our volunteers, chefs, and staff who have been working tirelessly since the COVID-19 crisis began.”</p><p>Project Angel Food also <a href=#>shared a post</a> on Friday from actress <strong><a href=#>Jamie Lee Curtis</a></strong> that praised Meghan and Harry.</p><p>“The great part about fame, be it earned or inherited, is the ability to take a public’s interest in the minutia of a famous person’s daily life and turn it into advocacy and support for wonderful institutions,” the L.A. native wrote. “Certainly that was the case when the Duke and Duchess delivered meals on Easter for my good friend&nbsp;@richardayoub&nbsp;and the organization that he runs&nbsp;@projectangelfood&nbsp;with passion, tenacity, intelligence and hope.”</p><p>The Halloween star, who spoke on a recent podcast about the impact Harry’s late mother, <a href=#>Princess Diana</a>, had on her and the world, commended the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and added that “while they delivered food they shone their light on a truly important and noble mission and helped immeasurably. I welcome them to my hometown and the Project Angel Food family.”</p><p>The couple and their son <strong><a href=#>Archie</a></strong>, 11 months, moved to L.A. in March after spending a few months in Canada amid their stepdown as senior members of the royal family.</p><p>Their deliveries weren’t the pair’s only charitable act this week. On Wednesday, April 15, they donated more than $112,000 in excess profits from their wedding broadcast to the U.K.’s Feeding Britain charity.</p><p>Harry also <a href=#>joined a video call</a> in support of one of his patronages, WellChild, in the U.K. and said that everyone should focus on spending quality time with their loved ones amid quarantine.</p><p>“You have got to celebrate those moments when you’re just on the floor rolling around in hysterics, because of something that’s happened,” he told the families who are caring for sick children, according to Hello! “As long as you guys are looking after yourselves and looking after each other that is the best that you can do.”</p><p>The British prince also joked that “having one kid at 11 months old is enough [work],” and he couldn’t “even begin to imagine how hard it is” for parents whose children have health issues and compromised immune systems as the world is affected by the spread of COVID-19.</p><p>Meghan also <a href=#>reconnected with the women of the Hubb Community Kitchen</a> in the U.K. in a video call this week. She previously worked with the volunteers in the aftermath of the 2017 Grenfell Tower fire in West London and released the Together: Our Community Cookbook to raise money for those impacted by the deadly blaze. Hubb Kitchen faces new challenges amid the coronavirus pandemic and is working with the Felix Project, a non-profit fighting hunger, to help feed those in need.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Scroll down to see pics of the couple’s PDA as they did good in L.A.</p><p><i>Given the constantly evolving nature of COVID-19,</i><i> </i><i><span class=markndy12k6eo data-markjs=true data-ogac data-ogab data-ogsc data-ogsb>Us</span><span class=markgqogkz98n data-markjs=true data-ogac data-ogab data-ogsc data-ogsb>Weekly</span> </i><i>wants our readers to have access to the most accurate resources.
