It‚Äôs unclear when she moved to the United States but she has seemed to be in the area a long time. She went on to become an Instagram influencer/model and once launched a lash line called Love Lashes amid her romance with Aaron. She also ‚Äúdabbled in porn,‚Äù according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Sun</a>.

Before Prince was born, Melanie also revealed she sadly suffered a miscarriage in 2020, shortly before she and Aaron became engaged. Just weeks before Aaron‚Äôs death, the on-again, off-again lovebirds were reportedly going through <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a custody battle</a> for their son after he claimed they both lost custody due to domestic violence and drug-use concerns.</p><h2>Melanie and Aaron had a rocky relationship.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/melanie-martin-aaron-carter-ss-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-9>The young couple made headlines for various dramatic moments throughout their relationship, including the moment Melanie was arrested and booked for domestic violence in March 2020.
