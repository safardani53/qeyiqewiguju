So it’s really kind of wild, a wild ride.”</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Donna, who has <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>two sons</a> in the NFL, mentioned that it’s “pretty cool” how young girls are getting into football because of Taylor’s appearances at the Chiefs games on September 24 and October 1. She also said that the NFL “is laughing all the way to the bank” thanks to Taylor.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“They’re getting the ramifications of everything,” she said. “I can tell you that they’ve told me personally that the Kelce family has done more good PR for football than they could’ve paid a million dollars to a PR firm. <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>It’s just because we’re relatable,</a> we’re normal, we’re genuine, we’re authentic, and we don’t put any airs on or be somebody that we’re not.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/donna-kelce-taylor-swift-seemingly-ranch-meme-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>On September 24, Donna went viral on the internet for sitting next to Taylor at the Chiefs-Bears game at Arrowhead Stadium. Before the game, the “Style” singer <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>reportedly went to Travis’ house</a> and joined his family and friends, including Donna, on a party bus that brought them to the game. The following week, Taylor attended the <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Chiefs-Jets game</a> in New Jersey with some of her famous friends like&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Ryan Reynolds</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Blake Lively</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>Sophie Turner</strong></a>. Donna, who sat with the group in box seats at MetLife Stadium,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>shared a video</a> with Taylor at the October 1 game. “Mama Kelce and Taylor Swift,” she captioned the post, along with a black heart emoji.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Fans are absolutely obsessed with Travis and Taylor, who have become the most talked-about duo in Hollywood. Neither star has confirmed that they’re dating, though it sure seems like it. Travis, for his part, explained on the September 27 episode of his and his brother <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jason Kelce</strong></a>‘s podcast, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>New Heights</a>, that he <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>wants to try to keep his dating life private</a> out of “respect” for Taylor.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>“She’s not into media, like I am doing this show every single week and having fun during the NFL season on other guys’ shows,” the professional athlete said on the podcast. “And any other show I go on from here on out — I am enjoying life, and I sure as hell enjoyed this weekend. And so, everything moving forward, me talking about sports and saying, ‘alright nah’ is kind of have to be where I keep it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH5xe49vZq2qkau2tHnKnqOcnV2ivK55w6ilp5ldl7%2BmrcqsZKyhnJq7pLGMqKVmrJGuubC%2BjKyuop6kYr%2BwucCnmp5n</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
