And that was on March 23rd. So then, they contacted me again April 17th."</p><p>After back-and-forth emails, Monique ultimately decided to not move forward with the video release since the compensation they were offering - $250, she claimed - was "not as much as Drew owed me."</p><p>When asked the purpose of <a href=#>Bravo</a> having the video, the entrepreneur claimed it was "to actually show my receipts because I have a whole bunch of proof that she was lying."</p><p>The chef added: "I don't know if they were trying to make her look bad. I was confused at the time, but now that I see the show, they probably just wanted me to stop her from lying."</p><p>On a recent episode, Drew shared her side of the story with the cast.</p><p>"She wanted to come and cook for my family and trial some of her food and it had hair in it and it was very trash," Drew said.</p><p>"She is not a chef. She is a girl who wanted to cook some food. I was not interested. She did not get the job."</p><p>The cast - including Sheree, <a href=#>Kandi Burruss</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Kenya Moore</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Marlo Hampton</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=#>Sanya Richards-Ross</a> - all laughed when they heard that the chef was suing her for only $1K.</p><p>Monique has since denied multiple times that there was "hair" in the food and said she was asked "several times" to cook for the family.</p><p>She is hoping that the show can eventually share her side of the story, given her emotional distress.</p><p>It is not looking hopeful, though, since filming for the current season has ended and the reunion has been filmed.</p><p>The U.S. Sun has reached out to Drew and Bravo for comment.</p><h2>TWO YEARS LATER</h2><p>After working for Drew in the fall of 2021, Monique claims that she's still dealing with problems with the reality star two years later.</p><p>She initially filed the lawsuit against the Bravolebrity in October 2022.</p><p>The fashion designer explained to The U.S. Sun: "I'm definitely upset.</p><p>"I've been going through mental anguish with this situation because I'm trying to make it a thing of the past and she's constantly bringing it up... [it] really took me into a dark place."</p><p>Monique claimed Drew keeps "telling lies," especially since she spent time with Drew's family, taking care of the children as a nanny.</p><p>According to the court docs, the $1K bill broke down as $600 for nanny services ($100 per child per day), $100 for maid services and $300 for chef services to feed a group of eight.</p><p>To date, Monique was only paid $150 by Ralph, who sent it as a gift "from the kindness of his heart," Drew stated in the docs.</p><p>Ralph later <a href=#>filed for divorce</a> from Drew in March after nine years of marriage and two children.</p><p>The former couple is currently embroiled in their own nasty court battle amid cheating rumors from both parties.</p><h2>ANOTHER LAWSUIT?</h2><p>Despite the mother of four saying she would "possibly" go back to court over this - due to the "toll on my mental health" - for now, she's letting it be and trying to keep calm and carry on.</p><p>Monique shared: "I'm trying to go back to my regular life and just leave it alone because it seems like I can't do nothing to her because she's such a liar.</p><p>"How do you even win with a person like that who can't tell the truth about nothing?"</p><p>She then compared her feud to "hitting a brick wall" and said it's just making her "sad, angry and have all these different emotions."</p><p>To earn some of the money back that she didn't receive, Monique is selling T-shirts for $25 and sweatshirts for $45 that take a dig at the TV personality.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"I did the service...run me my money!" is written on the fashion apparel.</p><p>Those interested can reach out to Monique via <a aria-label="Instagram (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> to purchase.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/rhoa-star-drew-sidora-s-838193061.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/www-instagram-com-drewsidora-headline-730017400.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/www-instagram-com-drewsidora-headline-730017818.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hwaGmDeIKTaKmhp5FisbOx1maqopyfp65ur8eenWaZo6CypXnBq5ivp12WvbGxwKtkrKCfrHqtrdasrKKsXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
