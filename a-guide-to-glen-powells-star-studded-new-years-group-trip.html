Over the years, Stamos has visited Glen and his family’s Texas ranch. In December 2023, Stamos recalled a time when Glen pushed him into the lake after he didn’t want to dress up for a party.</p><p>“We’re out on this pier by a lake and the dude walks up, tackles me, and throws me into the water,” the Full House alum said in an interview with <a href=#>Bustle</a> at the time. “I’m like, ‘Why?’ He goes, ‘Welcome to Texas.’ I’m like, ‘Go find my sunglasses.’”</p><h3>Caitlin McHugh</h3><p>Stamos’ wife was also invited to the festivities. She thanked Glen and his family for including her and Stamos in the comments section.</p><p>“Thank you for sharing a slice of heaven with us ❤️,” she replied.</p><h3>Rege-Jean Page</h3><p>Page was featured in several snaps from the group outing.

According to Ryan Murphy, who created Glee and Scream Queens, he met Glen thanks to his connection to Overstreet.</p><p>“[Co-creator] Ian Brennan said, ‘I know this guy Glen Powell, who’s roommates with Chord Overstreet, and I’ve been out with him and I’ve seen him do sort of improv stuff. I think he would be great,'” Ryan Murphy told <a href=#>E! News</a> in September 2015. “That led to me meeting Glen, and as soon as he read it you were like, ‘Oh, my god. Where have you been all my life?'”</p><p>Since finding success in Hollywood, Glen and Overstreet have remained close and been on several bro trips together.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/A-Guide-to-Glen-Powell-Star-Studded-New-Years-Squad-Trip-3.jpg><h3>Kayla Ewell</h3><p>Ewell shared the group selfie and other pics from the recent New Year’s trip on her respective social media. “NYE,” she captioned the slideshow.</p><p>Glen <a href=#>previously dated</a> <strong>Nina Dobrev</strong> from July 2017 to November 2017, who worked alongside Ewell on <a href=#>The Vampire Diaries</a>. Ewell and her husband, Novlan, have attended several of Glen’s events including his Halloween parties and the movie premiere of his film Devotion in 2022.</p><h3>Tanner Novlan</h3><p>In addition to sharing photos and videos from the trip on his page, Novlan, who is best known for his role in the Liberty Mutual commercials, commented on Glen’s post, “Gang gang.”</p><h3>Ashley Haas</h3><p>Haas, who is a sports broadcaster, shared an additional group shot from the trip with a reflective message for the new year.</p><p>“I was fortunate to spend this New Years with humans that could not be more real, down to earth, and above all kind,” she penned via <a href=#>Instagram</a>. “In 2024 I hope you you all surround yourselves with humans that make you happy. Live your life how you choose to do so and put yourself first!
