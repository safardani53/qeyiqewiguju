He is a happy bug and we’re just fixing his flat!” So what exactly does that mean? “Many newborns are born with a flat spot on their head and don’t need anything other than time to have it round out by six months,”&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Dr. Sherry Ross</a>, MD, told&nbsp;<strong>Hollywoodlife.com&nbsp;</strong>EXCLUSIVELY. “Other babies with a severe case of flat head syndrome need to wear a helmet that helps properly shape the head. A baby would start to wear a helmet 23 hours a day at around six months. Depending on the severity of the flat head, helmets are worn for two to six months.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>There’s no need for all babies with a flat head to wear a “lightweight” helmet like this one, but clearly little Miles’ case is severe enough to require one — and he’s at just the right age to remedy the problem. “A newborn baby’s head, especially at the top, is very soft and pliable during the first six months of life,” the doctor continued. “When a baby is still inside the uterus and has been in a certain position that puts pressure on the softest part of the skull, a flat area can develop. Other ways newborn babies can develop a flat head is if they sleep for long periods of time in the same position, have larger than usual heads, those born prematurely and those with weak muscle tone.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>However Miles developed a flat head, it’s great to see that Chrissy and&nbsp;<strong>John Legend</strong>, 39, are taking great care of their son! And can we just say, he looks absolutely adorable!</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>It’s no surprise that Chrissy would open up with her fans about Miles’ helmet, though. She always SO real when it comes to her kids, and fans were super supportive of her new pic. “He rocks it well,” one fan wrote, while another added, “Such a trendsetter.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWloZH5ze49tZpygop7AtMWMrZyin5WjerS7zWakoqSVqHqnuMCtZKGdkZl6tMXNnamopZVitaa4zJ6rZqiZmHw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
