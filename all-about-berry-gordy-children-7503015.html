Nearly 20 years later, his youngest, Stefan, was born.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I consider all of the wonderful Motown artists as my children," he said in an interview with Las Vegas Black Image magazine. "Raising my biological children was a little more complicated, because I was working with the artists all the time. Nevertheless, my children would travel with me to different places, and the same philosophy I would teach the artists at Motown, I would teach my own children."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Berry married his first wife, Thelma Louise Coleman, in 1953 and together, the pair welcomed three children: Hazel Joy, 68, Berry IV, 67, and Terry James, 66. They divorced in 1959. That same year, Berry had a son, Kerry Ashby, 63, with his second wife, Raynoma Singleton.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">During his marriage to Singleton, which lasted from 1960 to 1964, the famed record producer welcomed two more children: daughter Sherry, 60, born to songwriter Jeana Jackson, and son Kennedy William, 59, born to Margaret Norton.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Shortly after, Berry signed <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Diana Ross</a> to Motown and the two dated from 1965 to 1970. She gave birth to their daughter, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Rhonda Ross</a>, 51, in 1971. In 1975, Berry welcomed his eighth child, Stefan "Redfoo" Kendal, 47, with Nancy Leiviska.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Speaking with Las Vegas Black Image, Berry shared the philosophy he passed on to his kids. "True happiness comes from being truly proud of yourself for the accomplishments you make," he said. "My dreams are my dreams, and my children can learn from my experiences â€” but I want them to reach their own goals and make their dreams become realities."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Motown founder is notoriously private when it comes to his personal life, but his impact on music has kept him in the spotlight.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here's everything to know about Berry Gordy's eight children.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-hazel-joy-gordy-68></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Hazel Joy Gordy, 68</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagic</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Prior to founding Motown, Berry served in the U.S. Army during the Korean War. Upon returning home, he married Thelma Coleman Gordy, and the two welcomed their first child together the next year. Hazel Joy Gordy was born in August 1954 in Detroit.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hazel worked as a model and spent time at her father's record label, where she met <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Jermaine Jackson</a> of the Jackson 5. They were both 15 years old. The pair eventually tied the knot on Dec. 15, 1973, when they were 19.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We were able to grow up together," Hazel later told PEOPLE in 1980. "So we haven't had any problems."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hazel and Jermaine divorced in 1988. The former couple share three children: Jermaine Jackson Jr., born in 1977; Autumn Joi Jackson, born in 1978; and Jaimy Jermaine Jackson, born in 1987. Hazel became a grandmother in 2017 when Jermaine Jr. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>welcomed a son</a>, Soltan Jackson, with his longtime girlfriend <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Asa Soltan Rahmati</a>.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-berry-gordy-iv-67></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Berry Gordy IV, 67</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Ron Galella, Ltd./Ron Galella Collection/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Berry and Thelma welcomed their first son, Berry Gordy IV, in October 1955.

"People are always intrigued by the wonder of how it all happened ... And being Berry Gordy's son means I can always get a meeting!"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kerry added that his lineage comes with "certain stigmas attached," namely with funding â€” people assume Berry is financially backing his projects.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He and his wife, Karen Longley Gordy, have one daughter, Juliet Gordy, a model and actress born in 2000.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-sherry-jackson-gordy-60></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Sherry Jackson Gordy, 60</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Rob Latour/Variety/Penske Media/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sherry Jackson Gordy was born in Detroit in May 1963 to Berry and songwriter Jeana Jackson.

He's best known for his 1984 hit single "Somebody's Watching Me" featuring Jermaine and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Michael Jackson</a>. Despite his family ties, Kennedy didn't tell anyone who his father was while trying to score a record deal. He would even sometimes use a British accent in interviews. "I didn't want anybody to know or people to take the credit away from me," he told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Rolling Stone</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-69 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the same interview, he said that although his father didn't help him get a record deal â€” at one point, he even rejected his son's demo â€” Berry was still proud of him.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-71 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"All of a sudden, 'Somebody's Watching Me' comes on and my father goes 'Aw, man, you did it!

When Diana was two months pregnant, she married her first husband, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Robert Ellis Silberstein</a>. Rhonda was raised by Silberstein, along with her half-sisters <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Tracee Ellis</a> and Chudney, and didn't find out that Berry was her biological father until she was a teenager. Still, the music mogul was always in her life; she and her siblings called him "uncle."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-79 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Speaking to the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>New York Post</a> in 2015, Rhonda said that learning about her father was more a relief than a surprise.
